# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains detailed documentation, example notebooks (as well as tips & tricks) for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for various types of data using Python.

## Notebooks Overview

### 0. [Tips & Tricks](0-tips-n-tricks)
Tips & tricks on data processing, cleaning, chunking, and augmentation. It also highlights various approaches, accompanied by code snippets, for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Explore all the effective techniques and methods designed to enhance the accuracy of a RAG system.

**What you can find inside?**
- **Table Processing**: Techniques for processing of complex tables from the PDF documents.
- **RAG Evaluation**: Approaches for evaluation of precision, recall, faithfulness, etc. of your RAG system.
- **Query Extension**: Methodologies for enhanced retrieval (e.g., re-reanking, query extensions, etc.)

### 1. [RAG Contextual Compression](1-rag-contextual-compression)
Methods to compress context for RAG systems to improve performance and accuracy and minimize costs.

**What you can find inside?**
- **Context Summarization**: Techniques to provide only relevant information to retrievers
- **Embedding Compression**: Reducing the size of embeddings while maintaining information.
- **Cost Optimization**: How to make more with LLMs for less money?

### 2. [RAG for Semi-Structured Data](2-rag-semi-structured)
Implementation of a RAG system for semi-structured data.

**What you can find inside?**
