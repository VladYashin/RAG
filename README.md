### 5. [RAG Routing](5-rag-routing)
Techniques and examples on how to route queries effectively in RAG systems to ensure accurate and relevant information retrieval depending on user's intent.

**What you can find inside?**
- **Intent Detection**: Methods to accurately determine user intent from queries.
- **Query Routing**: Techniques for directing queries to the appropriate retrieval systems.
- **Response Optimization**: Enhancing the relevance and accuracy of generated responses.

### 6. [Corrective RAG](6-rag-corrective)
Techniques and examples on how to use corrective RAG (CRAG) to ensure the pipeline adheres strictly to the information it retrieves.

**What you can find inside?**
- **Fact Verification**: Methods to cross-verify retrieved information with trusted sources.
- **Correction Mechanisms**: Techniques for identifying and correcting inaccuracies in real-time.

### 7. [GraphRAG](7-graphrag)
Implementation & testing of Microsoft's GraphRAG pipeline with global & local searches using GPT-4o.

**What you can find inside?**
- **Graph-Based Retrieval**: Using graph structures to enhance the retrieval process by connecting related pieces of information.
- **Hierarchical Community Structure**: Building hierarchical communities within the graph for better context management and query responses using [Leiden algo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08473).
- **Local & Global Searches**: Utilizing local searches for detailed, specific queries within smaller subgraphs, and global searches to connect broader themes and insights across the entire knowledge graph.
