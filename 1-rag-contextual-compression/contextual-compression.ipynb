physiological or room tem-perature.\\n\\nA temperature-sensitive mutation is a changein the amino-acid sequence of a protein that causes theprotein to inactivate or fail to fold properly at such tem-peratu res.\\n\\n(1-12)\\ntemperature-sensitive mutants: organisms contain-\\ning a genetic mutation that makes the resulting proteinsensitive to slightly elevated temperatures.The temper-ature at which the mutant protein unfolds is called therestrictive temperature.\\n\\nThe term is also used for the\\nprotein itself.\\n\\n(3-11)\\ntertiary structure: the folded conformation of a pro-\\ntein, formed by the condensation of the various sec-\\nondary elements, stabilized by a large number of weakinteractions.\\n\\n(1-10)\\ntetramer: an assembly of four identical or different\\nsubunits.\\n\\n(1-19)\\nthermophilic: favoring high temperatures.\\n\\nA ther-\\nmophilic organism is one that requires high tempera-tures (above approximately 50 ºC) for survival.\\n\\nA ther-mophilic enzyme is one that functions optimally and isstable at temperatures at which mesophilic proteins\\ndenature.\\n\\n(1-12)TIM barrel: another name for the alpha/beta barrel fold.\\n\\n(1-18)\\ntorsion angle: the angle between two groups on\\neither side of a rotatable chemical bond.\\n\\nIf the bond is\\nthe C\\na–N bond of a peptide backbone the torsion angle\\nis called phi.If the bond is the C a–C backbone bond, the\\nangle is called psi.\\n\\n(1-3)\\ntranscription: the synthesis of RNA from the coding\\nstrand of DNA by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\\n\\n(1-2)\\ntransition state: the species of highest free energy\\neither in a reaction or a step of a reaction; the highestregion on the activation-energy barrier .\\n\\n(2-6)\\ntranslation: the transfer of genetic information from\\nthe sequence of codons on mRNA into a sequence of\\namino acids and the synthesis on the ribosome of thecorresponding polypeptide chain.\\n\\n(1-2)\\ntrimer: an assembly of three identical or different\\nsubunits.\\n\\n(1-19)\\ntwo-component systems: signal transduction systems\\nfound in bacteria and some eukaryotes involving a\\nmembrane-bound histidine kinase and a cytoplasmicresponse regulator protein that is activated by phos-phorylation.\\n\\n(3-15)\\nubiquitin: a small protein that when attached to other\\nproteins ( ubiquitination ), targets them for degradation\\nto the proteasome .Sometimes ubiquitin tagging tar-\\ngets a protein to other fates such as endocytosis.\\n\\n(3-11)\\nubiquitination: the attachment of ubiquitin to a pro-\\ntein.\\n\\n(3-11)\\nup-and-down structural motif: a simple fold in which\\nbeta strands in an antiparallel sheet are all adjacent insequence and connectivity.\\n\\n(1-17)\\nvan der Waals interaction: a weak attractive force\\nbetween two atoms or groups of atoms, arising fromthe fluctuations in electron distribution around thenuclei.\\n\\nVan der Waals forces are stronger between lesselectronegative atoms such as those found inhydrophobic groups.\\n\\n(1-4)\\nyeast two-hybrid: a method for finding proteins that\\ninteract with another protein, based on activation of areporter gene in yeast.\\n\\n(4-4)\\nzinc finger: a small, irregular domain stabilized by\\nbinding of a zinc ion.\\n\\nZinc fingers usually are found ineukaryotic DNA-binding proteins.\\n\\nThey contain signa-ture metal-ion binding sequence motifs.\\n\\n(1-18)', metadata={'page': 4, 'source': '../data/rag-con-comp-data\\\\nsp-protein-glossary.pdf'},
