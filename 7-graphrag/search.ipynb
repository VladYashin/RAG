    "# GraphRAG for Query-Focused Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach to the classic RAG framework with naive semantic-search approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphRAG process involves extracting a knowledge graph from raw text, building a community hierarchy, generating summaries, and then using these communities for RAG-based tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For community detection [Leiden algo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08473) is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Baseline RAG is Not Enough?\n",
    "Baseline RAG cannot connect the dots when the question involves information about certain attributes (people, locations, chemicals, games, etc.). Answering such questions requires traversing pieces of information via the shared attributes to provide new synthesized insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use GraphRAG?\n",
    "1. When the data contains a lot of misinformation, noise, or involves abstract questions.\n",
    "2. When RAG must be developed for a highly domain-specific niche.\n",
    "3. When prompt injection attacks must be avoided at all costs.\n",
    "4. When the user's questions are more vague than the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "1. Transcripts & written conversations\n",
    "2. News & social media\n",
    "3. Scientific papers (but careful, might result in hallucinations)\n",
    "\n",

    "### How GraphRAG Works?\n",
    "GraphRAG contains basically from two phases: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing Phase**\n",
    "    1. Inside each chunk we do:\n",
    "        - Entity extraction = People, places, names, plants, products, etc.\n",
    "        - Relationship extraction = Establishing/investigating the relationships between same entities in different chunks\n",
    "    2. Knowledge Graph Generation = Generation of set of nodes, which are basically based on the entities & relationships between entities.\n",
    "    3. Community Detection = Based on the nodes in the graph we detect which entities are closer to each other and which ones lie further apart.\n",
    "    4. Hierarchical Community Structure = The identified communities are then organized into a hierarchy, where larger, broader communities encompass smaller, more specific ones.\n",
    "    5. Summarization = Based on the insights, summaries are generated at different levels of the hierarchy, providing contextually rich insights for each community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Phase**\n",
    "    1. Select Community Level = based on the user's query identify the level of detailisation needed.\n",
    "    2. Retrieve Relevant Community Summaries = based on the granularity level all the relevant communities & their summaries are retrieved. Retrieved are: data points, entities, relationships and summaries.\n",
    "    3. Generate Partial Responses = Contextual Analysis = The retrieved info is analyzed to understand the relationships between entities. Like small bricks used for answering the user query.\n",
    "    4. Combined responses \n",
    "    5. Final answer\n",

      "### Analysis of Tiny Tim's Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided data, Tiny Tim's behavior cannot be described as deviant. The dataset consistently portrays Tiny Tim as a loving, hopeful, and innocent child who is deeply cared for by his family. There is no indication of any deviant behavior in the available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Familial Relationships and Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiny Tim's father, Bob Cratchit, is shown to be very affectionate towards him and is emotionally moved by Tim's thoughts and hopes [Data: Reports (20)]. The interactions between Tiny Tim and his siblings are described as playful and affectionate, further indicating a positive and loving family environment [Data: Reports (20)]. This strong familial bond underscores the innocence and positive nature of Tiny Tim's character [Data: Reports (18, 20)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Health Condition and Family Concern\n",
      "\n",
      "The data also highlights Tiny Tim's frail health condition, which is a significant source of concern for his parents, especially his mother [Data: Reports (19)]. Despite his physical frailty, Tiny Tim remains a hopeful and loving child, showing no signs of deviant behavior. His indifference to the toast made in Mr. Scrooge's honor may indicate his lack of regard for Mr. Scrooge, but it does not suggest any deviant tendencies [Data: Reports (19)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Tiny Tim's behavior is consistently depicted in a positive light, emphasizing his innocence and the strong familial bonds within the Cratchit family. There is no evidence in the dataset to suggest that Tiny Tim exhibits any deviant behavior [Data: Reports (18, 19, 20, +more)].\n",
