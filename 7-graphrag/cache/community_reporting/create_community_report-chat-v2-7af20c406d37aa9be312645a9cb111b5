He is stern, unkind, and dismissive, particularly towards his nephew and the idea of Christmas, often expressing disdain for the holiday and its associated merriment. Scrooge is strict about punctuality, displeased with his clerk Bob Cratchit for being late, and is skeptical and incredulous, even when confronted with ghostly apparitions. He is known for his tight-fisted, grasping, and solitary nature, and is part of the firm Scrooge and Marley, where he is described as Marley's sole executor, administrator, assign, residuary legatee, friend, and mourner. His name is trusted in financial matters, and he is noted for being an excellent man of business.\n\nScrooge's journey begins with his skepticism about the reality of Jacob Marley's ghost, who warns him about the visits of three spirits. Throughout the narrative, Scrooge is guided by these spirits through various scenes, reflecting on his past actions and their consequences. He experiences a wide range of emotions, from confusion, fear, and solemn dread to joy, gratitude, and ecstasy. These encounters lead him to revisit familiar places and memories, including his time as a young apprentice under Fezziwig, where he recalls the power of his former employer to make people happy or unhappy through his actions and words.\n\nAs Scrooge is shown scenes from his past, present, and potential future, he undergoes a significant transformation. He becomes deeply affected by the memory of Marley and the strange occurrences in his house, leading to a change in his emotional state. He experiences moments of despair, fear, and desperation, particularly in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. However, these experiences also evoke feelings of pity, regret, and a desire for redemption.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is profound. He becomes cheerful and generous, reflecting on what might have been if he had a daughter and showing an unusual interest in the Cratchit family's Christmas celebration.
