    "\n",
    "In this notebook there'll be covered the following **routing options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completion Routers** - LLM Completion Routers use an LLM completion call to return a single word that best describes the query from a list of word options provided in the prompt. This word is then used as part of an If/Else condition to control the application's flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Calling Routers** - LLM Function Calling Routers leverage the function-calling ability of LLMs to pick a route to traverse. Routes are set up as functions with appropriate descriptions, and based on the query, the LLM returns the correct function to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Routers** - Semantic Routers use embeddings and similarity searches to select the best route. Each route has associated example queries that are embedded and stored as vectors; the incoming query is embedded, and a similarity search determines the closest match.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Zero Shot Classification Routers** - Zero Shot Classification Routers use a Zero-Shot Classification model to assign a label to a piece of text from a predefined set of labels. They can classify new examples from previously unseen classes, making them versatile for various queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Language Classification Routers** - Language Classification Routers identify the language of the query and route it accordingly. They are useful for applications requiring multilingual parsing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Keyword Routers** - Keyword Routers select a route by matching keywords between the query and predefined route lists. They can be powered by LLMs or other keyword matching libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logical Routers** - Logical Routers use logic checks against variables such as string lengths, file names, and value comparisons to handle query routing. They rely on existing and discrete variables rather than natural language understanding.\n",
