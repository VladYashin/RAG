    "# RAG Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook there'll be covered the following **routing options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completion Routers** - LLM Completion Routers use an LLM completion call to return a single word that best describes the query from a list of word options provided in the prompt. This word is then used as part of an If/Else condition to control the application's flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Calling Routers** - LLM Function Calling Routers leverage the function-calling ability of LLMs to pick a route to traverse. Routes are set up as functions with appropriate descriptions, and based on the query, the LLM returns the correct function to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Routers** - Semantic Routers use embeddings and similarity searches to select the best route. Each route has associated example queries that are embedded and stored as vectors; the incoming query is embedded, and a similarity search determines the closest match.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Zero Shot Classification Routers** - Zero Shot Classification Routers use a Zero-Shot Classification model to assign a label to a piece of text from a predefined set of labels. They can classify new examples from previously unseen classes, making them versatile for various queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Language Classification Routers** - Language Classification Routers identify the language of the query and route it accordingly. They are useful for applications requiring multilingual parsing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Keyword Routers** - Keyword Routers select a route by matching keywords between the query and predefined route lists. They can be powered by LLMs or other keyword matching libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logical Routers** - Logical Routers use logic checks against variables such as string lengths, file names, and value comparisons to handle query routing. They rely on existing and discrete variables rather than natural language understanding.\n",

blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or \\ndigital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties.\\n\\nEach transaction in the \\npublic ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system.\\n\\nAnd, once entered, \\ninformation can never be erased.\\n\\nThe blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every \\nsingle transaction ever made.\\n\\nTo use a basic analogy, it is easy to steal a cookie from a cookie jar, kept \\nin a secluded place than stealing the cookie from a cookie jar kept in a market place, being observed by \\nthousands of people.\\n\\nBitcoin is the most popular example that is intrinsically tied to blockchain technology.\\n\\nIt is also the \\nmost controversial one since it helps to enable a multibillion-dollar global market of anonymous \\ntransactions without any governmental control.\\n\\nHence it has to deal with a number of regulatory \\nissues involving national governments and financial institutions.\\n\\nHowever, Blockchain technology itself is non-controversial and has worked flawlessly over the years \\nand is being successfully applied to both financial and non-financial world applications.\\n\\nLast year, Marc \\nAndreessen, the doyen of Silicon Valley’s capitalists, listed the blockchain \\u200bdistributed consensus \\nmodel\\u200b as the most important invention since the Internet itself.\\n\\nJohann Palychata from BNP Paribas \\nwrote in the Quintessence magazine that bitcoin’s blockchain, the software that allows the digital \\ncurrency to function should be considered as an invention like the steam or combustion engine that \\nhas the potential to transform the world of finance and beyond.\\n\\nCurrent digital economy is based on the reliance on a certain trusted authority.\\n\\nOur all online \\ntransactions rely on trusting someone to tell us the truth—it can be an email service provider telling us \\nthat our email has been delivered; it can be a certification authority telling us that a certain digital \\ncertificate is trustworthy; or it can be a social network such as Facebook telling us that our posts \\nregarding our life events have been shared only with our friends or it can be a bank telling us that our \\nmoney has been delivered reliably to our dear ones in a remote country.\\n\\nThe fact is that we live our life \\nprecariously in the digital world by relying on a third entity for the security and privacy of our digital \\nassets.\\n\\nThe fact remains that these third party sources can be hacked, manipulated or compromised.\\n\\nThis is where the blockchain technology comes handy.\\n\\nIt has the potential to revolutionize the digital \\nworld by enabling \\u200ba distributed consensus\\u200b where each and every online transaction, past and \\npresent, involving digital assets can be verified at any time in the future.\\n\\nIt does this without \\ncompromising the privacy of the digital assets and parties involved.\\n\\nThe \\u200bdistributed consensus\\u200b and \\nanonymity\\u200b are two important characteristics of blockchain technology.\\n\\n3', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\blockchain.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4 \\nSutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology Technical Report \\n \\nThe advantages of Blockchain technology outweigh the regulatory issues and technical challenges.\\n\\nOne \\nkey emerging use case of blockchain technology involves “\\u200bsmart contracts\\u200b”.\\n\\nSmart contracts are \\nbasically computer programs that can automatically execute the terms of a contract.\\n\\nWhen a \\npre-configured condition in a smart contract among participating entities  is met then the parties \\ninvolved in a contractual agreement can be automatically made payments as per the contract in a \\ntransparent manner.\\n\\nSmart Property\\u200b is another related concept which is regarding controlling the ownership of a property \\nor asset via blockchain using Smart Contracts.\\n\\nThe property can be physical such as car, house, \\nsmartphone etc.\\n\\nor it can be non-physical such as shares of a company.\\n\\nIt should be noted here that \\neven Bitcoin is not really a currency--Bitcoin is all about controlling the ownership of money.\\n\\nBlockchain technology is finding applications in wide range of areas—both \\u200bfinancial\\u200b and \\nnon-financial\\u200b.\\n\\nFinancial\\u200b institutions and banks no longer see blockchain technology as threat to traditional business \\nmodels.\\n\\nThe world’s biggest banks are in fact looking for opportunities in this area by doing research \\non innovative blockchain applications.\\n\\nIn a recent interview Rain Lohmus of Estonia’s LHV bank told \\nthat they found Blockchain to be the most tested and secure for some banking and finance related \\napplications.\\n\\nNon-Financial\\u200b applications opportunities are also endless.\\n\\nWe can envision putting proof of existence \\nof all legal documents, health records, and loyalty payments in the music industry, notary, private \\nsecurities and marriage licenses in the blockchain.\\n\\nBy storing the fingerprint of the digital asset instead \\nof storing the digital asset itself, the anonymity or privacy objective can be achieved.\\n\\nIn this report, we focus on the disruption that every industry in today’s digital economy is facing today \\ndue to the emergence of blockchain technology.\\n\\nBlockchain technology has potential to become the \\nnew engine of growth in digital economy where we are increasingly using Internet to conduct digital \\ncommerce and share our personal data and life events.\\n\\nThere are tremendous opportunities in this space and the revolution in this space has just begun.\\n\\nIn \\nthis report we focus on few key applications of Blockchain technology in the area of Notary, Insurance, \\nprivate securities and few other interesting non-financial applications.\\n\\nWe begin by first describing \\nsome history and the technology

decentralized IoT platforms.\\n\\nThe blockchain technology facilitates the implementation of decentralized IoT \\nplatforms such as secured and trusted data exchange as well as record keeping.\\n\\nIn \\nsuch an architecture, the blockchain serves as the general ledger, keeping a trusted \\nrecord of all the messages exchanged between smart devices in a decentralized IoT

Resignation has had on developers.\\n\\nFollowing the \\nGreat Resignation of 2020–2021, we are now seeing a developer talent shortage, motivated largely by \\ncompensation and a desire for remote work.\\n\\nThere is also a small but clear movement for developers to \\nleave jobs to start their own companies, indicating that entrepreneurship is strong among this group.\\n\\nThose who remain at their jobs are also stretched thin, with technical debt and lack of resources as top \\nchallenges for developers today.\\n\\nOther main findings show that organizations continue to rely on open source projects for their software \\ndevelopment, and participation in the community remains strong.\\n\\nLow-code and no-code solutions, \\nwhich enable developers and non-developers to create applications without advanced coding skills, \\nhave garnered mixed feelings as they become more common, but Kubernetes and serverless solutions \\nare both growing in adoption.', metadata={'source':

numbers.\\n\\nAdditionally,  \\n42% of those who haven’t left their jobs yet are considering or may \\nconsider leaving their current jobs this year.\\n\\nBoth those who have already \\nleft and those considering leaving jobs are motivated by two main factors: \\nCompensation and fully remote or flexible work environments.\\n\\nWith an \\nongoing rise in inflation and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, it’s clear \\ncompanies need to offer high pay and work flexibility to retain developers.\\n\\nDeveloper \\nattitudes on \\ncloud trends  \\ncan be mixedNew cloud trends can draw mixed opinions.\\n\\nIt’s clear that containers are \\nhere to stay, with 68% reporting using containers for some projects,  \\nand the usage of serverless computing is picking up, with 44% using \\nserverless already and 61% of that group expecting their usage to  \\nincrease this year.\\n\\nHowever, opinions on low-code and no-code solutions \\nare mixed, with developers with less years of experience being more  \\nlikely to see the use of low-code, and those with more experience rating \\nthem as overhyped.\\n\\nDespite the rise of talk around blockchain and  \\nWeb3 technologies, 67%

microfluidic large-scale integration (mLSI) [1] has been a rapidly growing\\nfield over the past decade and is widely used in biomedicine and biochemistry.\\n\\nComposed of\\nvarious microfluidic components and interconnected microchannels, microfluidic biochips in-\\ntegrate the laboratory experiments of chemical synthesis and biological analysis [2], including\\nsampling, dilution, reaction, separation, etc.\\n\\nThus, it is also known as Lab-on-a-chip (LoC)\\n[3].\\n\\nThrough precise manipulation of small fluids, especially on the sub-millimeter scale [2],\\nLoC can greatly shorten the sample processing time and achieve the maximum utilization\\nefficiency of reaction samples and reagents, which provides extremely broad prospects in\\nbiological and medical fields.\\n\\nAs the potential of mLSI biochips is being exploited, they are gaining increasing com-\\nplexity in structure and features.\\n\\nHowever, similar to the early development of integrated\\ncircuits, the disadvantages of manual design—time-consuming and error-prone—became\\nmore obvious, which is inevitable for the manual design of highly complex mLSI chips.\\n\\nIn\\nrecent years, researchers of design automation for mLSI have been making attempts to replace\\nthe conventional AutoCAD manual design process [4], and now a promising solution has\\nemerged.\\n\\nCloud Columba1, developed by Tseng and colleagues from the Technical University of\\nMunich (TUM), can interpret users’ input of device specifications and generate optimized\\ndesigns of the chip layouts automatically [5].\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 1.1, Columba provides a\\nuser interface where users can specify the type, quantity, and some specific properties of the\\nrequired components.\\n\\nThese components are defined in Columba’s module library, module\\nmodels [6, 4].\\n\\nFor now, Columba has two different modules available for the user: ring mixer\\nand chamber container, but these can only provide the most basic features of mLSI.\\n\\nColumba’s\\nresearchers believe that it is necessary to expand the module library by introducing more\\n1https://cloud-columba.org/\\n1', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nmodule model categories [7].\\n\\nHowever, they are facing the same problem as described earlier\\nin the mLSI chip design.\\n\\nAt the moment, in order to design a new component, designers have\\nto draw the design first on AutoCAD and then interpret it into a .JSON file that conforms\\nto the format of the module models.\\n\\nOn the one hand, components are very likely to have\\ntwo layers interacting with each other, and designers cannot define the layer interaction on\\nAutoCAD.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the design drawings cannot be processed into the required\\nformat automatically.\\n\\nManual interpretation is tedious and will only add to the time and\\npersonal costs.\\n\\nThus, it goes against the initial intention of design automation.\\n\\nFigure 1.1: UI of Cloud Columba.\\n\\nNonetheless, Columba’s concept still holds great potential, as it is able to perform the\\noptimization of the mLSI layout on its own without human intervention.\\n\\nBut in order to\\nexpand its module library, Columba’s researchers need a dedicated module design tool that\\ncan solve the problems discussed above.\\n\\nIn this project, we propose Module Sketch, a web-based interactive design platform for\\n2', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 8}),

module design application for\\nColumba, it allows users to describe how the component could be integrated into microfluidic\\nchips, and generate a design output as a .JSON file which is guaranteed to meet the rules and\\nstandards of Columba’s module models.\\n\\n3', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='2 Background\\nIn this chapter, we will take a closer look at the fluid control mechanism of mLSI, and then\\nwe will provide a general introduction to front-end technology.\\n\\nAt last, we will have a review\\nof the computer-aided design (CAD) for mLSI [5] currently in use.\\n\\n2.1 Fluid Control of Continuous Microfluidics\\nAs mentioned before, the most remarkable feature of mLSI is its precise fluid control, which is\\nsupported by the interaction of microfluidic layers.\\n\\nAlthough the fluid control mechanism in\\nsingle-layered microfluidic chips has recently begun to be explored [8], interactions between\\nthe microfluidic flow layer and control layer are still the mainstream way to fulfill this\\nfeature.\\n\\nThe reaction samples and reagents are located in the flow layer, flowing along the\\nchannels within [9].\\n\\nMade from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), microchannels have an elastic\\nmechanical property and can therefore deform when pressure is applied.\\n\\nThe control layer\\nlies above the flow layer and consists of control channels and pneumatic valves, which are\\nplaced on top of the flow channels.\\n\\nWhen activated by air pressure, the valve squeezes the\\nflow channel and blocks the fluid within.\\n\\nCorrespondingly, when the air pressure is released,\\nthe blockage will be lifted, which will allow the fluid to be transported further [9].\\n\\nAs part of the continuous microfluidic chip, a microfluidic module also contains the\\naforementioned layer-to-layer interactions.\\n\\nFigure 2.1 [4] shows an example of a continuous\\nmicrofluidic chip design, where the flow channels are denoted by red color, and the control\\nchannels and the valves are denoted by green color.\\n\\n(a) and (b) are two different components\\nthat involve the interaction between layers.\\n\\n4', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='2 Background\\nFigure 2.1: A design generated by Columba 2.0 [4].\\n\\n(a) A switch.\\n\\n(b) A rotary mixer.\\n\\n2.2 Front-End Techniques\\nThe development of the front-end is a reflection of the development of the Internet itself.\\n\\nSince the inception of the Internet, front-end developers have been working on enriching the\\ncontent and the interactivity of web pages in pursuit of the best user experience.\\n\\nHyper Text Markup Language (HTML) [10], Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript\\nhave been the core of front-end development since the very early days of the Internet.\\n\\nAt\\npresent, HTML6 is on the horizon, but we can still recall the revolution that HTML5 started in\\nOctober 2014 through a variety of new features, including: the multimedia elements <audio>\\nand <video> and the graphic elements <svg> and <canvas> .\\n\\nJavaScript was standardized\\nby European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) since 1997 under the alias\\nECMAScript [11].\\n\\nIt can dynamically modify the Document Object Model (DOM) structure in\\nresponse to user events on the browser.\\n\\nIn the mid-2000s, the Internet entered the era of Web\\n2.0, where the concept of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) [12] played an important\\nrole.\\n\\nAJAX made it possible to update the web content without reloading the whole page and\\nis widely used by popular applications, such as Google Maps and Gmail.\\n\\nFor a large-scale front-end project, complex interactions and massive logic processing can\\n5', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='2 Background\\nresult in a huge amount of JavaScript code, which increases the difficulty of development\\nand maintenance.\\n\\nHence the Model View Control (MVC) framework is proposed to simplify\\nthe front-end development.\\n\\nThrough reasonable organization and layering, the front-end\\ncode becomes cleaner and logically clearer, making the functionality enhancements and\\ntesting much more convenient.\\n\\nCurrently, React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js are the three most\\ncommonly used front-end MVC frameworks.\\n\\n2.2.1 Scalable Vector Graphics\\nAmong the features of HTML, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) plays the most important part\\nin our application.\\n\\nSVG is an Extensible Markup Language (XML).\\n\\nIt has been developed by the World Wide\\nWeb Consortium (W3C) since 1999 [13].\\n\\nAn SVG document, which consists of only the <svg>\\nroot element and shape elements inside of it, can be inserted almost anywhere in the HTML\\nbody.\\n\\nThe user can not only easily scale, rotate or translate SVG but also apply filters on it or\\nuse SVG for animation.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, SVG is used to represent vector graphics.\\n\\nUnlike bitmaps, which\\nare a bunch of pixels, vector graphics are independent of resolution and, therefore, can be\\nrendered at any size without any loss of quality.\\n\\nThis feature is critical for our design tool.\\n\\nIn\\norder to draft a precise design, users need to constantly zoom in and out on the parts they\\nare working on.\\n\\nDesign in the work area should always be clearly presented to the users and\\nSVG has an absolute advantage in this regard.\\n\\nAnother benefit of the <svg> element is that it has a DOM interface, and therefore we can\\nattach JavaScript event handlers to <svg> elements or the elements inside the <svg><\\\\svg>\\ntags, which makes them more convenient to modify.\\n\\n2.2.2 JavaScript\\nJavaScript is a scripting language that is also one of the three core technologies of the World\\nWide Web (WWW).\\n\\nIt was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 [14] to add interactivities to\\nwebsites.\\n\\nJavaScript allows developers to capture users’ activities on the browser, such as\\n6', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='2 Background\\nmouse, keyboard, and wheel activities, and bind customized event handlers to them.\\n\\nIt\\nprovides local storage to store data and methods to modify the content or the style of the\\nwebsite.\\n\\nSince 2009, with the release of Node.js [15], JavaScript has transformed from a\\nlanguage that ran purely on the client-side to one that is equally useful on the server.\\n\\nAccording to a recent survey published by SlashData [16], JavaScript remains the most\\npopular programming language for the tenth survey in a row, with close to 17.5M developers\\nworldwide using it.\\n\\nGitHub’s 2021 Octoverse Report [17] showed similar results (Figure 2.2).\\n\\nFigure 2.2: \"Top languages over the years\" from Octoverse Report 2021 [17].\\n\\n2.2.3 Front-End Frameworks\\nAfter JavaScript laid a path for the dynamic interaction of web pages, in order to establish the\\nuser interface of the websites quickly and simplify the development, front-end frameworks\\nemerged, which are usually based on JavaScript or TypeScript.\\n\\nAccording to the survey result\\nof State of JS 2021 (Figure 2.3) [18], the mainstream frameworks and libraries in the front-end\\nfield are still React, Vue and Angular, while some new frameworks like Svelte also have\\nincreasing competitiveness.\\n\\nReact was created and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) [19].\\n\\nIt was first used\\nfor establishing Facebook’s internal products like Instagram and then released to the public\\nin 2013.\\n\\nIt supports component reuse and is attracting the attention of more and more\\ndevelopers.\\n\\nAngular [20] is the successor of AngularJS (both owned by Google).\\n\\nWith Angular, devel-\\n7', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='2 Background\\nSatisfaction\\n Usage\\nFigure 2.3: Rankings of front-end frameworks from State of JS 2021 [18].\\n\\nopers can easily build complex websites with user-defined components.\\n\\nAngular is equipped\\nwith a large ecosystem, and it supports two-way data binding, which means that if the value\\nof a variable in the model changes, the DOM tree (view) will be modified accordingly, and\\nvice versa.\\n\\nVue’s creator Evan You used to work at Google using AngularJS [21].\\n\\nHence Vue inherited\\nthe advantages of the powerful AngularJS, including the component-based pattern and two-\\nway data binding [22].\\n\\nAnother benefit of Vue is that it is more simplified and lightweight,\\nwhich is the reason why we use Vue as the framework in this project.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Vue is also\\nperfectly capable of supporting complex single-page application (SPA) development when\\nused with related tools and libraries, such as Vuex, a state management1pattern for Vue\\napplications.\\n\\n1Pinia has recently replaced Vuex as the official state management library for Vue.\\n\\nFor more information see:\\nhttps://vuex.vuejs.org/\\nhttps://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html\\n8', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf',

for\\ncontinuous microfluidics developed by Tseng’s team from TUM.\\n\\nFor now, three versions have\\nbeen successively released: Columba, Columba 2.0, and Columba S [6, 4, 23].\\n\\nEach version\\nhas a significant improvement over the previous one, which shows great potential in mLSI\\nmanufacture.\\n\\nAs mLSI is the integration of microfluidic modules, the usability of design automation is\\nhighly dependent on the variety of its module library, which is the module models in the\\nscope of Columba.\\n\\nEach module model has well-defined flow and control channels within a rectangle-shaped\\nboundary.\\n\\nAll the junctions, where channels can be connected to external devices, lie on the\\nboundary [4].\\n\\nWhat Columba does is decide how the module is geometrically integrated onto\\nthe chip, and which junctions are used as connections to other devices.\\n\\nFigure 2.4 (a) shows the schematic of the module model for a ring mixer.\\n\\nFlow channels are\\ndenoted by blue color.\\n\\nThe left and right sides are connected to the external of the module.\\n\\nControl channels are denoted by light green color and valves by orange, pink, or dark green\\ncolor.\\n\\nEach valve could be bound to one or several control pins and have different binding\\noptions.\\n\\nFor example, (b)(c)(d) are the three binding options for the same valve, which is\\nbound to the sixth and seventh control pin.\\n\\nBinding options will be further discussed in\\nsection 3.2.\\n\\n2.3.2 3DµF\\n3DµF2is a web-based open-source interactive microfluidic system

architectural design, AutoCAD is the universal solution for\\ndesign drafting.\\n\\nThe same goes for continuous microfluidics chips, and attempts have been\\nmade to make AutoCAD more applicable.\\n\\nFor instance, in 2009, Amin’s team from the\\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) proposed an AutoCAD-plugin named Micado\\n[25], which supports automatic valve placement and routing for the control layer of simple\\ncontinuous microfluidic chips.\\n\\nHowever, our goal is to develop a module design platform for Columba.\\n\\nAlthough with\\nAutoCAD alone, users can perfectly present the structure of the components to be designed,\\nthey cannot describe control bindings or generate output in the format that Columba desires.\\n\\nOn the other hand, compared to web

user-friendly interface, which is worth for reference.\\n\\n11', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='3 Functional Requirements Analysis\\nIn this

meantime, the user can still step back and delete a shape that has\\nbeen added to a binding option, but our application will then modify the binding options\\naccordingly, since it cannot allow an undefined figure to remain in the system.\\n\\n12', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='3 Functional Requirements Analysis\\n3.1 Drafting\\nAs discussed before, a continuous microfluidic component usually consists of two layers: a\\nflow layer and a control layer.\\n\\nFor both layers, drafting is an essential functionality, where\\nusers draw up the designs from scratch by adding and editing entities that represent chambers,\\nchannels, and valves.\\n\\nIn order to optimize our user experience in drafting, we need to clarify a lot of details,\\nalthough many of them may seem intuitive to users nowadays.\\n\\nAs we are building our App\\nfrom scratch, every detail that may influence user experience matters and is worth our extra\\nthoughts and attention.\\n\\nThe central idea is that a good application should act the same way\\nas the user would expect.\\n\\nShape Drawing: We simplify the entity design process to shape drawing since the compo-\\nnent parts like chambers and channels can be represented by shapes like solid rectangles\\nand polylines, respectively.\\n\\nUsers should be able to draw basic solid and hollow fig-\\nures, such as rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, polygons, and polylines, and by\\ncombining these basic shapes, they can create complex figures.\\n\\nShape Selecting & Editing: The shapes in the work area should be flexible.\\n\\nThe selected\\nshapes will be highlighted, and have assisting points around them, which users can\\ndrag and drop for editing operations, such as moving and resizing.\\n\\nGroup Selecting: If multiple shapes are supposed to be edited in the same way, like moved\\nby the same offsets or copied, we should not ask the user to repeat the same operation\\nfor each shape.\\n\\nThe user may need to select a group of shapes and move or copy them.\\n\\nSwitching between layers: As stated before, if a component has two layers, the user may\\nneed to design them separately.\\n\\nWhen the user is operating on one layer, the other layer\\nshould be automatically set as inactive, meaning that it cannot be accessed, but it is still\\nvisible with less opacity so that the user can have an overall observation.\\n\\nZooming and Panning: Zooming and panning can either be achieved with the mouse\\nwheel (like AutoCAD) or by clicking buttons or with hotkeys (like Adobe Photoshop\\nor Illustrator).\\n\\nExperienced users would prefer the mouse wheel or hotkeys, but for\\ninexperienced users, buttons are the most straightforward solution.\\n\\nBoth are worth\\n13', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='3 Functional Requirements Analysis\\ntaking into account.\\n\\nPins: Users may need to mark some points with notations, such as inlets or outlets of the\\nfluids.\\n\\nPins are only visible during the designing process and will be ignored in output\\ngeneration.\\n\\nCopy and Paste: For the shapes that may appear multiple times or in a pattern, copy and\\npaste will save the repetitive work.\\n\\nRedo and Undo: It is necessary for a design tool to enable users to discard and resume\\nprevious operations.\\n\\nSnap: The vertices of shapes or midpoints of line segments are often critical points that\\nusers may want to reuse.\\n\\nMaking them snap points will help the user to find the exact\\nposition for drawing and editing.\\n\\nCtrl and Shift key: Ctrl and Shift keys are assigned various functions and are widely used\\non all kinds of user interfaces.\\n\\nBesides hotkeys like Copy (Ctrl+C ) and Paste (Ctrl+V ), a\\ncombination of Ctrl or Shift and mouse click can also modify the selection by adding\\nor removing the item from the selected group.\\n\\nIn addition, on design tools like Adobe\\nIllustrator, pressing the Shift key while drawing may add constraints to the shape and\\nforce users to draw only horizontal or vertical lines, perfect circles, squares, etc.\\n\\n3.2 Control Bindings\\nSo far, we have covered almost all the features of the flow layer, but in the control layer, users\\nwill additionally describe the behavior of valves and control channels.\\n\\nCloud Columba treats every component as a rectangular block with control pins on the\\nboundary.\\n\\nEvery control channel is connected to its unique control pin and the valves that it\\ncontrols.\\n\\nIn most cases, a valve can be controlled by multiple pins.\\n\\nFor this concept, we use the\\nterm binding options for the valve, and we call the task of choosing one viable binding option\\nfor a valve or valve group (some valves only exist in groups) a control task .\\n\\nAn important part\\nof the work of Cloud Columba is to complete each control task for all the components on\\nthe mLSI.\\n\\nIn short, we must design a way to describe the control tasks for the component to\\n14', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='3 Functional Requirements Analysis\\nmake sure that Columba knows everything needed for this process.\\n\\nIt is straightforward to add binding options for a single independent valve by following\\nthe steps shown below:\\n1.\\n\\nSelect a valve.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStart adding a new binding option.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nSelect channels.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nFinish adding the binding option (or discard selection).\\n\\nWe specify single and independent because the complexity of adding binding options will\\ngreatly increase in other cases.\\n\\nCurrently, there are two typical situations:\\n•Pumps\\nAs mentioned above, some valves do not exist alone but are only concatenated together\\ninto a group by control channels.\\n\\nSuch a valve group is usually called a pump .\\n\\nUsers\\ncan form a pump by selecting the valves from the work area, and then the pump can be\\ntreated like a single independent valve, meaning that users can add binding options for\\nit through the process given above.\\n\\n•Linked valves\\nIn contrast to independent valves, if two valves are linked together, their binding options\\nwill be treated as one control task, meaning that only one of them can exist in the final\\ndesign.\\n\\nThis procedure works differently from creating a group: when the user forms a\\ngroup, the chosen valves can still be added to other groups.\\n\\nHowever, a valve or a valve\\ngroup can only be linked once.\\n\\nNote that both situations above may occur simultaneously, that is, users may need to link\\nvalve groups.\\n\\nTake Columba’s mixer as an example (Figure 2.4), (e), (f) and (g) are three\\npossible implementations of the mixer in the final layout.\\n\\nWe can see in (f) and (g) that both\\nimplementations have the pump in the middle of the bottom of the mixer.\\n\\nThe pump supports\\ntwo different physical structures to enable flexible pin access.\\n\\nNamely, it is composed of\\neither three or four valves.\\n\\nIn this case, the user needs to form two groups, namely one group\\nof three valves and one of four, to represent this pump.\\n\\nThis raises a problem since the two\\ngroups are not independent of each other because we cannot choose one binding option for\\n15', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='3 Functional Requirements Analysis\\neach of them.\\n\\nIn other words, the two groups must be linked together so that they belong to\\nthe same control task.\\n\\n3.3 Relative Coordinate & Output Generation\\nOn the microfluidic chip design software, components are mostly variable in size, and some\\nchannels can be extended to make the component scalable.\\n\\nThus, in our application, the\\nfigures displayed in the work area do not necessarily match the corresponding shapes in\\nthe final microfluidic chip design.\\n\\nTo support the extensible channels, we have to introduce\\nthe concept of relative coordinate (denoted by xRel ,yRel ) and, accordingly, absolute coordinate\\n(xAbs ,yAbs ).\\n\\nIn the representation of a component, every point has its unique absolute and relative\\ncoordinates.\\n\\nThe relative coordinate indicates the position of a reference point with respect to\\nthe whole design layout.\\n\\nBoth xRel and yRel have the value of a rational number between 0\\nand 1.\\n\\nTake xRel as an example, the value 0 represents the leftmost end of the design, and\\nvalue 1 is the rightmost end.\\n\\nThe absolute coordinate represents the distance between the\\npoint and its reference point.\\n\\nGiven the position—the top left corner—of a component on an LoC ( X, Y ), the size of the\\ncomponent ( width ×height ) and a point P on the component with relative coordinate ( xRel ,\\nyRel ) and absolute coordinate ( xAbs ,yAbs ), then the coordinate of P on the LoC ( P .x, P .y ) can\\nbe calculated as follows:\\n \\nP.x\\nP.y!\\n\\n:= \\nX+xRel∗width +xAbs\\nY+yRel∗height +yAbs!\\n\\n(3.1)\\nAfter the user defines relative coordinates for every point in the component design, the\\nentire design process is complete.\\n\\nThen a .JSON file can be exported, which contains all the\\ninformation of the design.\\n\\nListing 3.1 shows the structure of the .JSON output.\\n\\nListing 3.1: The structure of the output\\nnode :=

pan, and two additional modes\\nonly available for the control layer: valve and bind.\\n\\nThe top toolbar has three buttons.\\n\\nWith the first one, user can toggle between area mode and channel mode, which can\\naffect the selected shapes or new shapes to be drawn.\\n\\nRedo/undo can be triggered by\\nthe next two buttons, as well as by hotkey Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Z .\\n\\nWork Area - The work area occupies almost the entire page and is where all SVG elements\\nare rendered.\\n\\nThus, most event listeners are assigned to the work area.\\n\\nIt consists of\\nmultiple layers of SVG, including SVG of snap points and assisting points for editing.\\n\\nSnap points and assisting points must be rendered above the content.\\n\\nOtherwise, they\\nmight be blocked by other shapes and cannot catch any user events.\\n\\nOn the bottom is\\nthe background grid, which assists the user in aligning.\\n\\nSide Panels - The panels on the right side imply the current status.\\n\\nOn the

Structure\\nThe code of Module Sketch follows the default Vue3 project structure and the official style\\nguide1, namely, we keep our project directory flat and avoid reduplicative nesting (Figure 4.2).\\n\\nAs we are building a SPA, index.html is the start site and also the only .html file in\\nthe directory.\\n\\nIts body contains one single element <div id=\"app\"></div> , where the root\\ncomponent App.vue will be mounted.\\n\\nFigure 4.3 shows the Vue component tree of App.vue .\\n\\nFor a large-scaled SPA with nested components that share the same states, we need to pass\\nthe states from the parent components to the children as properties, and when a child wants\\n1https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/\\n19', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page':

system,\\nthis may lead to problems for maintenance, as it is hard to track which component did the\\nmodification.\\n\\nIn this case, centralized state management will greatly simplify the task.\\n\\nInstead\\nof passing the states down layer by layer, all components can get direct access to the states, as\\nwell as the mutations and actions to modify them.\\n\\nThus, any state modification can be easily\\ntracked.\\n\\nWe use Vuex as our state management solution.\\n\\nMore information about Vuex can\\nbe found in its documentation2.\\n\\nThe structure of our centralized store is shown in Figure 4.4.\\n\\nIn index.js we store the root\\nstates, which include the highly coupled states relevant to drafting features.\\n\\nOther states and\\ntheir modification methods are

introduce its implementation.\\n\\n4.4.1 Shape Drawing\\nWe provide three drawing modes: (rounded) rectangle, ellipse, and polygon/polyline.\\n\\nPin\\nmode works in the same way as drawing a line section with an extra text entering step.\\n\\nAfter\\nselecting the drawing mode, the user can add points to the work area to define a new shape.\\n\\nAny shape will be defined by a certain number of points.\\n\\nFor instance, each rectangle\\nis defined by two points on one of its diagonals and each rounded rectangle needs one\\nadditional point to define the corner radius.\\n\\nA polyline can be defined by points of any\\nnumber greater than one.\\n\\nMistakes are likely to occur during the drawing process, so the user should be able to\\nexecute the step out command at any time.\\n\\nIt is, in our case, a right-click.\\n\\nAfter issuing this\\ncommand, the program will check whether the currently drawn graphic is valid.\\n\\nNamely, if\\nthe graphic has a qualified number of points, it will stay in the work area.\\n\\nOtherwise, it will\\nbe discarded.\\n\\nThe same applies to the polyline drawing process because it will not terminate\\nautomatically before the next right-click, as there is no upper limit on the number of points\\nfor polylines.\\n\\nIn addition, users can close a polygon by moving the cursor close to the starting\\npoint, and clicking when the end point is snapped to it.\\n\\nWe depict the drawing process of Module Sketch in a state diagram (Figure 4.5).\\n\\nListing 4.2\\nshows the pseudocode of the corresponding event handlers.\\n\\nListing 4.2: The

of each element is initialized with itself).\\n\\n•union(a, b) : Merge the set containing the element awith the set containing b.\\nTheoretically, the optimized operation of find or union on disjoint

the group and the single valves it contains\\nshould belong to the same control task, since one valve cannot be assigned to multiple control\\ntasks.\\n\\nThus, to form a new valve group through the selection, we need to merge all control\\ntasks that contain at least one of the selected valves.\\n\\nThe same goes for the editing of a valve\\ngroup, and control tasks with newly added valves will

Interpretation\\nBefore we get the final result, the design must be preprocessed by setting relative coordinates.\\n\\nIt can be done through two simple steps shown in Figure 4.8.\\n\\nFirst, we need to enter all the relative values in a form ( 4.8a).\\n\\nBy default, three values\\nwill be given for both the x-axis and the y-axis, namely 0, 0.5, and 1.\\n\\nUsers can also delete\\nunnecessary values, as well as add new ones, then fill out the form with absolute values (as\\nsuggested by the rulers).\\n\\nTo avoid potential mistakes, we recommend users to use the get\\n31',

values function, which will iterate over the content and assign the absolute thresholds\\nto relative values 0 and 1 (even if they are deleted).\\n\\nIntermediate values are then assigned\\nby proportion.\\n\\nBefore proceeding to the next step, the user can choose the algorithm for\\ncalculating the default relative coordinates, which gives either the closest or a fixed relative\\npoint.\\n\\nIn the second step( 4.8b), the user can modify the default settings computed in the previous\\nstep.\\n\\nWhen all is settled, the user can click the finish button.\\n\\nIt will tell the system to create\\nand mount the Vue component AppOutput , where the result will be displayed (Figure 4.9).\\n\\nThe\\nfunctions of interpreting the design to the JSON format are implemented in AppOutput.vue ,\\nas they are not shared by other Vue components.\\n\\n32', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='4 Design &

goal of developing a user-friendly design platform for microflu-\\nidic components.\\n\\nModule Sketch can simplify the design process of microfluidic IP modules,\\nand support the module library expansion for design automation software.\\n\\nAlthough, in practice, the roles of UI/UX designers and developers are usually separated,\\nwe put a lot of thought into analysing, designing, and optimizing the interactivities between\\nthe user and our application.\\n\\nThis process provides us with the foundation and framework\\nfor our implementation, upon which the comprehensive and flexible features of drafting,\\ndescribing binding options, and design interpretation are implemented.\\n\\nIn addition, Module Sketch is a pure front-end application with no back-end implementa-\\ntion involved, which means that once the page is loaded, there will be no more interactions\\nbetween the server and the browser.\\n\\nEverything will be handled locally on the client-side.\\n\\nAs for the compatibility, we developed Module Sketch on Google Chrome and tested it on\\nFirefox and Microsoft Edge, making it fully supported by the mainstream browsers.\\n\\n34', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 40}), Document(page_content='6 Future Work\\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the vision for potential future work from our own view.\\n\\n6.1 Load Existing Designs\\nModule Sketch currently only allows users to design mLSI components from scratch, namely,\\nusers cannot load existing designs and edit them.\\n\\nIn the future, we might enable the user to\\ncontinue the previous work by uploading the existing design of .JSON and parsing it into the\\nwork area.\\n\\n6.2 Netlist Recognition\\nThe idea is to bind some figures or some vertices in the work area together so that the user\\ncan edit the whole group conveniently and avoid misediting on figures that are dependent on\\nthe group.\\n\\nHowever, what we expect is not simply to form groups by selecting figures, but\\nthe automatic recognition of the netlist.\\n\\nIt could be an extension of snapping: when the user\\noperates with the snap point, the relevant figures will be bound, and if one of the figures is\\nmoved, the position of the others will be modified accordingly.\\n\\nThis is only an idea at present,\\nand the specific mechanism has yet to be designed, but it may be useful in some scenarios.\\n\\n6.3 State Management Migration\\nDuring the developing process, we used Vuex 4 as the solution for our centralized store,\\nbut recently the official state management library for Vue projects was changed to Pinia.\\n\\n35', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 41}), Document(page_content='6 Future Work\\nAlthough Vuex 4 is still maintained, new features may not be added to it.\\n\\nThus, migrating to\\nPinia might be an appropriate choice.\\n\\n6.4 Drafting Feature Extension\\nAs Columba is still in the development stage, it is likely that there will be new requirements\\nthat Columba needs to meet.\\n\\nFor example, the channel width for Columba is currently fixed,\\nbut it may need to support customized channel width in the future.\\n\\nIn such cases, Module\\nSketch needs to make corresponding adjustments.\\n\\nAnother potential reinforcement is the\\nfunction of drawing arcs.\\n\\nAlthough we have implemented the triangle circumscribed circle\\nalgorithm to define the arc with three points, this function was eventually deprecated due to\\na lack of flexibility.\\n\\nThere is a possibility that this feature will be achieved by other means\\nin the future.\\n\\nFor instance, a function of adding rounded corners to polylines would be an\\noption to consider.\\n\\n36', metadata={'source': '../data/rag-routing\\\\web.pdf', 'page': 42}), Document(page_content='List of Figures\\n1.1 UI of Cloud
