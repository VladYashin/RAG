It is easy to visualize safely cruising down the highway \\nwhile reading for pleasure or writing a work email—rather than watching the \\nroad. Vehicle automation promises to transform how people get to work, run errands, and generally travel through the nation’s streets and highway systems. \\nChildren could commute to school alone, without relying on a parent. One can \\nalso imagine a sight-impaired person traveling alone to a doctor’s appointment. In \\ncities, someone could hail an autonomous vehicle with a ride-sharing app and ride \\nwith other passengers going a similar direction. The idea of driverless robot cars has captured the public’s imagination as automakers and technology companies \\npromote the potential leisure, safety, and environmental benefits of AVs.\\nT oday, automakers are already adding features to new vehicle models that assist \\ndrivers, such as parking assistance, lane centering, and automatic braking. As these \\nfeatures become standard in cars, automakers have set their sights on creating autonomous vehicles that do not need drivers at all. Silicon Valley and ride- and \\ncar-sharing companies are investing in technology and betting on the transporta -\\ntion sector’s shift toward autonomous vehicles. \\nIn the midst of these advances in vehicle technology, the international community \\nis working to address one of the greatest challenges of our time: climate change. \\nThe United States has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 26 \\npercent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and to achieving greater emis -\\nsions reductions in the future.\\n1 T o meet that goal, the United States will need to cut \\nemissions from the transportation sector, which accounted for 26 percent of the \\ncountry’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. Of these transportation sector emis -\\nsions, 61 percent came from light-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars.2 \\nAutonomous vehicles—particularly those that are passenger cars—could sig -\\nnificantly affect the country’s ability to cut greenhouse gas emissions and move \\ntoward a carbon-free economy. Existing studies suggest that three main factors \\nwill determine whether putting more AVs on the road increases or decreases ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='2 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\ntailpipe carbon emissions: effect on the total vehicle-miles traveled in the United \\nStates; impacts on congestion; and AVs’ fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consump -\\ntion. As such, autonomous vehicles must be assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on carbon emissions levels. \\nT o that end, the Center for American Progress reviewed the existing literature \\non the environmental impacts of automation in the light-duty vehicle sector. We \\nfound that existing research does not draw clear and consistent conclusions about \\nthe impact of autonomous vehicles on the environment generally and climate specifically. In particular, the research reviewed shows that:\\n• \\nVehicle miles traveled, or VMT—the aggregate number of miles driven by \\nvehicles in a given year—could increase because automation lowers the \\nopportunity cost of driving. This could encourage people to take more car trips \\nor accept longer commutes, since drivers would be able to multitask in vehicles \\nrather than focusing on the road. Additionally, autonomous vehicle technology \\ncould allow groups of people currently unable to drive—such as the elderly, young, and people with disabilities—to travel alone in autonomous vehicles, \\nputting more people on the road. \\n• \\nVMT could decrease if autonomous vehicle technology is paired with ride- \\nand car-sharing services. A system of shared autonomous vehicles could \\ndiscourage individual car ownership and use technology to plan efficient routes \\nto transport people from point to point. At the same time, however, shared \\nautonomous vehicles could increase overall VMT if they make frequent pas -\\nsengerless trips to pick up their next client. Specialized software programs could \\nmitigate this effect by planning the most efficient routes. \\n• Automation could reduce congestion and make each mile traveled more effi -\\ncient. Autonomous vehicles that communicate with each other and their sur -\\nroundings may drive more smoothly, without needing to frequently brake and accelerate. Fully autonomous and connected vehicles could reduce the number \\nof traffic accidents and, therefore, unnecessary idling on roads.\\n• \\nDrivers may not realize the congestion benefits of automation for years, \\nuntil a large share of vehicles on the road are equipped with autonomous \\ntechnology. In the shorter term, VMT and congestion could worsen as autono -\\nmous vehicles join the fleet without displacing traditional vehicles. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='3 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\nAutomakers and boosters of autonomous vehicle technology argue that autono -\\nmous vehicles have the potential to transform the U.S. transportation sector and \\nmake it more efficient. T o manage this transformation, however, policymakers \\nneed more definitive research on how deployment of autonomous vehicles could affect the environment in the short- and long-term. \\nIn 2016, emissions from the transportation sector surpassed those from power \\nplants.\\n3 The private sector and policymakers should conduct deeper research into \\nthe emissions impact of autonomous vehicles before committing the United States to a transportation path that could lock the country into more VMT and higher \\nlevels of carbon pollution. CAP recommends several potential avenues for addi -\\ntional research, including the effects of automation on travel patterns and VMT; \\nalternative fueling; driver behavior and value of driving time; traffic data collec -\\ntion and sharing; and the role of electric drivetrains in autonomous vehicles. \\nWhile many effects of autonomous vehicle deployment remain to be seen, \\nresearchers do know for certain that emissions can be minimized by electrifying \\nlight-duty cars. As autonomous vehicles become more common on the nation’s \\nroads, the logical way to guarantee a positive environmental impact is to combine autonomous technology with electrification.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='4 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\nWhat are autonomous vehicles?\\nAs established by the National Highway T raffic Safety Administration, or \\nNHSTA, there are five levels of automation starting at level 0, or no automa -\\ntion.4 (see T able 1) Level 0 vehicles may have passive sensors that detect \\nexternal objects and provide warnings to drivers but nothing more.5 Level 1, or \\nfunction-specific automation, assists drivers in controlling specific vehicle func -\\ntions, such as adaptive cruise control, electronic stability control, lane centering, and automatic braking.\\n6 Level 2, also known as combined-function automation, \\nautomates two or more individual vehicle control functions to work together \\nin place of driver specific commands.7 Examples of level 2 automation include \\nadaptive cruise control functioning simultaneously with lane centering.8 Level \\n3, or limited self-driving automation, allows the driver to be relieved of driving the car while remaining ready to retake control.\\n9 At the top of the spectrum is \\nlevel 4, full self-driving automation, which allows the car to function completely without a driver. While levels 1 through 3 all require some level of human driver \\nparticipation and control, level 4 represents the only true driverless car and may or may not have basics such as steering wheels.\\n10 \\nSAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, has estab -\\nlished a similar framework for levels of automation, with one main difference: the SAE system separates NHSTA’s level 4 into two levels—level 4 and level 5. A \\nlevel 4 vehicle can drive completely on its own under some driving conditions, \\nsuch as within a specific geographic area. A level 5 vehicle can drive on its own \\nin any driving conditions.\\n11 \\nIn the 1980s, the BMW Group released its first model with electronic stability \\ncontrol, or ESC. ESC uses sensors and an automatic braking system to bring the car back in line when stability wavers. While it appears under other names, such \\nas interactive vehicle dynamics in Ford Motor Co. vehicles, many manufacturers \\nhave been employing this level 1 technology in vehicles since the 1990s.

Collectively, these three categories \\nare known as vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology, or generally as vehicle \\nconnectivity. \\nVehicle connectivity technology allows a vehicle to perform driving functions \\nwhile staying aware of lane divisions, medians, and pedestrians and bicyclists. \\nIt also communicates information to the vehicle and other vehicles on the road \\nabout red lights, traffic jams, and unexpected impediments such as ice, approach-ing bad weather, animals, or even a child running into the street.

On its own, autonomous vehicle \\ntechnology will not affect carbon emissions from light-duty vehicles; however, the \\napplication of the technology will herald changes in how Americans, particularly \\nin urban areas, travel from one place to another. A transformational change in the \\ntransportation system could have significant implications for the climate. \\nWhether AVs mitigate or worsen carbon pollution from light-duty vehicles in the \\ntransportation sector will depend on three key factors: their effect on the total \\nvehicle-miles traveled in the United States; their impacts on congestion; and their fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption.\\nResearch on these factors, however, has so far been limited and inconclusive. A \\n2014 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory particularly highlights \\nexamples of the uncertainties in existing research. The study found both potential \\npositive and negative energy outcomes of increased AV use across all automation \\ntechnology levels. Among the positive impacts are enabling electrification of vehi -\\ncles and making vehicles more lightweight.

An increase in VMT generally leads to an \\nincrease in tailpipe emissions unless otherwise offset by improvements in vehicle \\nefficiency and pollution control. Consequently, whether automation leads to greater travel demand or reduces VMT will help determine the climate impact of \\nAV deployment. So far, researchers have drawn contradictory or uncertain conclu-\\nsions about the aggregate effects of automation on VMT . \\nThe RAND Corporation conducted a literature review of existing studies and \\nconcluded, “ AVs appear likely to reduce many of the costs typically associ -\\nated with automotive travel, which [is] likely to stimulate growth in VMT . ”\\n45 \\nEssentially, automation could reduce the opportunity cost of driving—or the \\npotential loss a driver might experience by choosing to drive over other activi -\\nties, given limited time in a day. In an AV , an individual can engage in other \\nactivities—such as checking email or reading—while the car maneuvers itself \\nand therefore does not have to give up that time. As a result, people may choose \\nto live farther away from their workplaces or take vehicle trips they otherwise \\nwould have avoided due to the opportunity cost.46 \\nIn addition, automation could put entirely new classes of drivers on the road. In \\n2013, the Eno Center for T ransportation examined the impacts of deploying fully autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-everything technology. \\nOne important gap in this research is the quantification of impacts. In its analysis, \\nEno did not attempt to quantify or assign monetary value to the predicted impacts. \\nThe magnitude of the effects on the environment would depend on how much \\nadditional VMT is induced. Eno concluded that travel demand could increase with automation, as AVs could facilitate personal mobility for those who cannot drive \\non their own—the elderly, the young, and people with disabilities.\\n47 Sarah Hunter, \\nthe policy director for X, the technology innovation component of Google, has acknowledged this challenge: “What we’re going to have is people who are locked \\nat home able to get around for the first time. That’s a great outcome from an equity perspective.

Essentially, the number of \\neligible drivers may increase, but the way Americans transport themselves will change as well. Individual car ownership will likely give way to on-demand ride-\\nsharing and car-sharing powered by AV technology.\\n49 Automation \\ncould put \\nentirely new \\nclasses of drivers on the road.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='13 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\nThe Massachusetts Institute of T echnology’s Senseable City Laboratory has con-\\nducted research on AVs in urban settings. They concluded that fully autonomous \\nvehicles incorporated into ride- and car-sharing programs—known as shared \\nautonomous vehicles—could reduce the number of vehicles on the road 80 per -\\ncent while still getting every passenger to where they need to be, when they need \\nto be there.50 The Eno Center for T ransportation further suggested that shared AVs \\nwould not have to drive around looking for parking, as city drivers of conventional vehicles often do, thereby cutting VMT .\\n51 \\nThe University of T exas at Austin partnered with the University of Utah to study \\nthe potential benefits of shared autonomous vehicles, even at low levels of market penetration. The researchers simulated a fleet of shared autonomous vehicles \\noperating in Austin, T exas, that combined on-demand services such as UberPool \\nwith full automation. They also created algorithms to ensure efficient pickups and \\ndrop-offs. Under these circumstances, one shared autonomous vehicle replaced \\n9.3 regular vehicles, assuming that one person drove each regular vehicle alone and made three trips each day.\\n52\\nIt remains unclear whether transitioning to a shared autonomous light-vehicle transportation system would fully offset any increase in VMT from adding new \\ndrivers and demand. While the number of vehicles on the road could decline, \\noverall distance traveled by the autonomous vehicles on the road could increase. The UT Austin and University of Utah analysis above found that as shared AVs \\n“move in order to better serve current unserved and future anticipated demand,” \\nVMT can increase.\\n53 Initial modeling in a small market share shows dramatic \\nincreases in VMT . The researchers’ simulation produced an 8 percent increase in \\nVMT when shared AVs represented just 1.3 percent of car trips.54 \\nWith a small number of shared AVs on the road, each would have to drive a certain \\ndistance to reach its next customer, and many of these trips would be “deadhead -\\ning,” or making a trip without a passenger.55 With greater market penetration, and \\nin a denser urban setting, shared AVs would have to drive fewer miles to reach \\ntheir next customers, as there would likely be more cars close by to each customer. \\nResearch by David Levinson predicts an initial VMT increase from deadheading, although he suggests that a shared AV system and logistical planning can minimize \\nthe passengerless miles.\\n56 As Levinson discusses, the portion of AVs that will be \\nprivately owned versus shared is uncertain and will affect overall travel demand.57 Some experts see \\nride-sharing and \\ncar-sharing as a \\npotential antidote to rising VMT from automation.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='14 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\nGoogle’s testing of its AV prototype demonstrates the potential endurance of a car \\nwith no driver that is constantly on the road. In January 2016, Google reported \\nthat each of its self-driving test vehicles was driving, on average, 10,000 autono -\\nmous miles to 15,000 autonomous miles per week on public streets. Since 2009, \\nthe cars had cumulatively driven nearly 1 million miles in manual mode and more \\nthan 1.4 million miles in autonomous mode.58 In contrast, as of July 2016, the \\naverage U.S. driver drives 13,476 miles annually.59 \\nCongestion\\nRelated to the issue of travel demand and VMT is traffic congestion. A car driving \\nthrough heavy traffic uses more fuel and emits more pollutants than a car mov -\\ning smoothly through an uncongested area over the same distance. Congestion, therefore, is more than a quality-of-life issue for drivers; it is an environmental and climate issue as well. \\nResearchers have identified two primary ways that AV technology could help \\nreduce congestion—and therefore vehicle emissions—in cities and on high-\\nways: by making driving patterns more efficient and by averting crashes that cause severe traffic jams. Uncertainty remains, however. The potential benefits \\ndepend in part on the level of fleetwide automation achieved and whether the \\nvehicles are able to communicate with each other and their surrounding infra -\\nstructure.\\n60 Moreover, AVs could cause congestion to increase in the short term \\nbefore easing in the long term.\\nAs described above, RAND concluded that AVs might lead to more vehicles on \\nthe road in some areas as the opportunity cost of driving falls. This could increase \\ncongestion. RAND also found, however, that AV technology could help to avoid \\ninefficient driving conditions, such as abrupt stops and starts common in heavy \\ntraffic. Even at higher speeds on highways, dramatic braking and other human \\nreactions can cause congestion. Without these reactions, cars could travel close together safely. In essence, more cars could get through the same limited number \\nof lanes more easily with automation technology, reducing congestion and stream-\\nlining the overall driving process.\\n61 RAND also found that automation—espe-\\ncially at levels 3 and 4—could reduce the number of automobile accidents and, \\ntherefore, the traffic backups that often accompany them.62 As with other factors, \\nthese potential benefits depend on what portion of cars on the road are AVs.AV technology \\ncould help reduce \\ncongestion by making \\ndriving patterns more efficient and averting crashes that cause \\nsevere traffic jams.

The company’s analysis predicts that even at higher speeds, braking can occur simultaneously thanks to enhanced vehicle-to-vehicle communication, if employed in fully autonomous vehicles or vehicles with \\nhigh levels of automation and a human driver.\\n63\\nFor the past few years, Oak Ridge National Laboratory has also been looking into \\nthe effects of automation on congestion—and the potential positive impact on \\nreducing emissions. As of 2014, researchers at Oak Ridge were developing algo -\\nrithms for communication among autonomous vehicles. Implementing these algo -\\nrithms, according to Andreas Malikopoulos of the laboratory’s Urban Dynamics Institute, would eliminate traffic jams by allowing the cars to talk to each other. In \\nan interview with Scientific American about his research, Malikopoulos explained, \\n“Based on this instruction, you will never get in a traffic jam. … If all vehicles are \\ncoordinated, they will never have to come to a full stop or a red light. ”\\n64\\nSome stakeholders warn that the congestion benefits of AVs are unlikely to occur in the short term. The Eno Center notes that many congestion benefits “may not \\nbe realized until high AV shares are present. ”\\n65 Similarly, Here, a mapping company \\nowned by leading automakers, found that while ultimately, automation could alle-viate congestion, it would not happen for decades, and congestion would increase \\nin the near term before declining. In the next five years, some areas might experi -\\nence less congestion as AVs trickle onto the roads, but then congestion would \\nactually increase as more AVs mix in heavily with traditional vehicles. It is not until \\nAVs saturate the market—likely 20 years to 50 years from now—that congestion \\nwould ease significantly.\\n66\\nFuel consumption\\nResearchers from the Eno Center for T ransportation have found that AV technol -\\nogy could reduce fuel consumption in the transportation sector by smoothing out driving patterns and minimizing braking.\\n67 This research remains speculative, as \\nthe fuel consumption benefits rely largely on the market penetration of AVs and a number of other factors.

The authors cite another study \\nfinding that with a 20 percent reduction in accelerations and decelerations, cars would consume 5 percent less fuel.\\n69 \\nZia Wadud, Don MacKenzie, and Paul Leiby have summarized existing research studies on efficient driving and fuel consumption. One study concluded that if a gasoline-powered engine was operating at its most efficient point, helped by eco-\\ndriving programming that minimizes braking, an AV could reduce fuel consumption \\n35 percent to 50 percent in heavily congested driving conditions, although such \\ncongestion is only occasionally found in the real world.\\n70 Urban driving with lots of \\nstop-and-go traffic could see the largest increases in fuel economy, but these results will depend on the algorithms engineered into drive systems.\\n71 The authors caution, \\nhowever, that other studies raise concerns about a “take-back effect,” where eco-driving—characterized by slower speeds and gentler accelerations—could increase \\ncongestion and therefore offset potential fuel consumption benefits. They concede that it is “possible that eco-driving practices will deliver little system-wide benefit. ”\\n72\\nWadud, MacKenzie, and Leiby also looked at studies on highway platooning, in which vehicles follow each other closely on the highway, thereby decreasing the \\nair resistance for cars following the leader. They estimated that universal adop -\\ntion of platooning for light-duty vehicles—an ambitious assumption—could \\nreduce the energy intensity of vehicles 3 percent to 25 percent. If all heavy-duty \\ntrucks platooned, a feature that automated technology could facilitate, their \\nenergy intensity would drop 10 percent to 25 percent.\\n73 It is unclear whether \\nuniversal adoption of platooning is practical in real-world conditions, and these \\npredictions are based on extrapolation of existing observations. Factors such as \\nthe saturation of AVs on the road and the ratio of heavy-duty trucks to light-duty vehicles could influence the impacts on fuel economy. \\nResearchers from Volvo published their own analysis of the effects of automated \\nfeatures such as platooning and adaptive cruise control, which automatically adjusts \\nthe distance between cars when driving.

Policymakers \\nmay decide to lift highway speed limits if they no longer have to factor in the human element to determine a safe speed. Highway travel accounts for 33 percent \\nto 55 percent of all road travel; consequently, faster highway speeds could increase \\nenergy intensity 7 percent to 22 percent for all light-duty vehicles.\\n77 \\nNotably, concerns about fuel consumption are moot if autonomous vehicles on the road are electric vehicles. Wadud, MacKenzie, and Leiby suggest that automation technology could encourage the deployment of electric vehicles by \\neliminating an important barrier to electric vehicle adoption—the anxiety about \\nwidespread availability of refueling infrastructure. Fully autonomous vehicles \\ncould travel to fueling stations to fuel up on their own.\\n78 \\nThe UT Austin study offers a different perspective on fuel consumption and \\nrelated emissions. Shared AVs in a connected system would be in near-constant motion, picking up and dropping off multiple passengers throughout the day, so \\nthe engine would stay warm. Each shared AV would require fewer cold starts, or \\ntimes when the engine starts after remaining idle for an hour or more. Emissions \\nare higher when the engine is cold than when the catalytic converter has warmed \\nup, so keeping the engine warm would reduce emissions.\\n79\\nSome automakers have argued that even low-level AV technology achieves some of these fuel economy and emissions benefits.

The exist -\\ning research shows conflicting conclusions about whether AV deployment will \\nreduce or induce travel demand.

A similar modeling exercise would be very beneficial \\nfor studying the impacts of different advanced vehicle technologies in North \\nAmerica, which would allow policymakers to tailor policy promoting zero-\\ncarbon vehicle technology accordingly.\\n95 This type of modeling could also help \\nresearchers compare the effects of automation on travel patterns with the effects of \\nexpanded public transit.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\AutonomousVehicles-report.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='23 Center for American Progress | The Impact of Vehicle Automation on Carbon Emissions\\nConclusion\\nAutomakers, tech giants, and ride-sharing companies are spearheading a signifi -\\ncant transition in the transportation sector. Companies across the spectrum are \\ndeveloping cars and supporting technology that will eventually allow cars to drive \\nthemselves. As this technology advances, it is critical that researchers and policy -\\nmakers carefully examine the effects of these autonomous vehicles not only on \\nsafety and personal mobility but on the environment as well—particularly as they \\nrelate to the fight against climate change. While some research exists on how AVs \\nwill affect driving patterns, congestion, and accidents, further research is neces -\\nsary to tease out whether AV deployment will increase or decrease vehicle carbon \\nemissions. Under some circumstances, AVs could increase the number of miles \\nAmericans drive each year—and therefore increase emissions. In other scenarios, \\nAVs could make driving more efficient and less polluting. All that is certain is that uncertainty remains as to whether automation of vehicles will help the United \\nStates respond to climate change. \\nPolicymakers, automakers, and tech companies need to invest in additional \\nresearch to clarify the environmental and climate impacts of automation. At the \\nsame time, they should recognize that ensuring that autonomous vehicles are \\nelectric, rather than gasoline-powered, would render concerns about tailpipe \\nemissions moot. Electric vehicles are the logical choice for a cleaner transporta -\\ntion future—automated or not.

Such ve-\\nhicles include Autonomous (AV) and Connected Vehicles (CV) as w ell as Electric Ve-\\nhicles.  \\nAccording to [14] Connected Vehicles are considered “vehicles that use any of a num-\\nber of different communication technologies to communicate with the driver, other cars \\non the road (vehicle-to-vehicle [V2V]), roadside infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastruc-\\nture [V2I]), and the “Cloud” [V2C] .” The U.S. Department of Transportation's Na-\\ntional Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defines Au tonomous or fully \\nautomated or “self-driving” vehicles as “ Automated vehicles are those in which at least \\nsome aspects of a safety-critical control function (e.g., steering, throttle, or braking) \\noccur without direct driver input” [45].  In 2014 the Society of Automotive Engineers \\n(SAE) classified AVs in 6 different levels of automation, from level 0 - where no sys-\\ntems interfere with driving tasks, to full automation level 5 [ 52]. \\nWhile the terms Connected Vehicle or Autonomous Vehicle refer t o the way a vehi-\\ncle’s course is controlled, the terms Plug-in Hybrid Electric ( PHEVs), Battery electric \\nvehicles (BEVs) or Hybrid electri c vehicles (HEVs) refer to the  way the vehicle is pow-\\nered. Literature defines that Electric Vehicles or EVs are thos e that are  powered \\nsolely by electric rechargeable batteries. On the other hand, P lug-in Hybrid Electric \\nvehicles are those that are powered by a combination of both el ectric batteries and  a \\npetrol or diesel engine [66]. Therefore, both Connected and Aut onomous Vehicles can \\neither be Electric, Plug-in Hybrid Electric or conventional gas oline/petrol empowered.  \\nWhen it comes to transport, some of the basic motives, driving scientists to improve \\nvehicle technology, are improved vehicle and road safety and le ss vehicle emissions. \\nEspecially when it comes to CAVs, much effort has been given to  define the environ-\\nmental outcome of their implementation both concerning ghg emis sions and noise. \\n2 Environmental issues due to traffic \\nTraffic sector has an impact both on air and noise pollution [8 , 2, 62, 63, 48 and 61]. In \\norder to be able to fully understand and interpret the environm ental impact of new kinds \\nof vehicles, gas emission standards, environmental regulation a nd ghg emissions im-\\npacts on the environment should be taken into consideration.   \\nAccording to literature [8, 18, 41], there are four major green house gasses that are \\nresponsible for the earth’s tempe rature. These major GHGs are c arbon dioxide (CO 2), \\nmethane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and fluorinated gases; CO2’s enters the atmos-\\nphere basically as a product of fossil fuel (coal, natural gas,  burn process), Methane is \\nemitted during the production and transport of coal, natural ga s, and oil and Nitrous \", metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='3 \\noxide comes from agricultural and industrial activities, while fluorinated gases are syn-\\nthetic gases emitted from a variety of industrial processes [18 ]. In a study conducted by \\nPolicy Department A at the request of the European Parliament C ommittee [43] authors \\nacknowledge the existence of a variety of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), \\nhydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (P M), which are prod-\\nucts of the automo tive sector.   \\nAccording to [8] “the transport sector is a major contributor to CO2 emission be-\\ncause of its dependency on fossil fuels” .  As mentioned in (European Commission, \\n2012) almost 23% of CO2 gases produced in all 27 EU member coun tries has its origin \\nin the transport sector, while t he equivalent percentage for th e US reaches 34 % [18].  \\n   The impacts of Greenhouse Gase s on the environment, originat ing from the transport \\nsector, are widely reported by authors. Climate change, air pol lution, health problems, \\ndegradation of water and soil quality are among the most import ant ones [3 in 17, 51, \\n55, 53] with climate change being of high interest.  \\nTreaties such as the Kyoto Protocol [33], established in 2005, and the Paris Agree-\\nment [33], established in 2016, are in force so as to enhance t he fight against global \\nwarming. Furthermore, other legal frameworks, such as the Europ ean Legislation \\n“2020 climate & energy package” [21], enacted in 2009, set goal s for the reduction in \\nCO2 emissions. Legislation on fuels can be found in the USA, da ting back to 1975 \\n(Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE standards [1]). CO2 emissi ons standards \\nwere introduced by the EPA in cooperation with NHTSA [43] in 20 10 and re-adjusted \\nin 2012, and are still into effect.   \\n3 AV Adoption patterns and pote ntial benefits - Low Carbon \\nMobility, Shared Mobility, On – demand Mobility \\nApart from the legal framework that is set in order to reduce c arbon emissions, other \\npractices are introduced aiming to put a halt to the increase o f CO2 emissions that orig-\\ninate from the transport sector. A shift to shared mobility or on-demand mobility is \\nproposed by many authors, as an answer to the GHG problem. Such  a shift is also sug-\\ngested as the ideal way to enhance the positive impacts of new kinds of vehicles on the \\nenvironment [26, 38, 32, 58, 39, 46, 19, 64,57].  \\nCAVs’ implementation in the market and traffic is supposed to b ring a big number \\nof potential benefits: user convenience, increased road and veh icle safety, reduction of \\ncrashes, decrease of congestion,  improved emissions, equity, re duced cost of travel \\ntime, parking space saving [35, 11, 2 and 65]. Among the main a nticipated benefits of \\nthe CAVs implementation stand the reduction of crashes, the inc rease of road capacity, \\nthe decrease of congestion and fuel consumption and change in t ravel behavior [22]. \\nThe last two aforementioned benefits are both able to affect th e amount of GHGs caused \\nby transport. Having this in mind, new ways of car use are intr oduced. In particular, ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4 \\nshared mobility, low carbon mobility and on-demand mobility tra vel behaviors are \\nstrongly suggested by investigat ors around the world as the sol ution.  \\nAccording to [23] “Low Carbon Mobility (LCM) is defined as mobility that results \\nin lower levels of carbon” .  Another term used in literature is that of Low Carbon Mo-\\nbility Plans (LCMP), which are defined as a set of actions in o rder to achieve “desirable \\naccessibility and mobility pattern for people and movement of goods in the cities”  [60]. \\nPhilp and Taylor in [49] suggest that “an optimum blend of technological development, \\ninfrastructure adjustment, innovative policy developments, and community behavior \\nchange is required”  in order to achieve the reduction of GHG emissions. On-Demand \\nMobility is described by [26] as “the use of shared vehicles accessed on demand” , and \\nit can vary in forms, such as car sharing, ridesharing/carpooli ng, transportation net-\\nworks and e-hail services. It is through such driving behaviors  that a possible increase \\nof the VMT, resulting from CAV implementation, can be counterba lanced. \\n4 Connected and Autonomous Vehicles’ anticipated \\nEnvironmental Impacts  \\nAs mentioned above, the implementation of CAVs as well as the u se of alternative fuel \\nas gas or electric power to empower vehicles, are supposed to h ave an impact on the \\namount of the GHG emissions originating from traffic. Due to th e importance of this \\nmatter, many researchers have tried to estimate or quantify the  size of the anticipated \\neffects on the environment. In this section, a review of litera ture on the potential envi-\\nronmental impacts is presented and results are summarized. The papers reviewed are \\ndisplayed on table 1. \\nAuthors use different approaches . They either use previous work s’ estimates to reach \\nconclusions or they use mathematical frameworks and data availa ble to extract numer-\\nical results concerning gas emissions, energy consumption, etc.  Research is done based \\non the fact that environmental impacts of autonomous technology  originate from the \\nvehicles themselves, the network system as a whole and from the ir users. Much re-\\nsearch is done on how autonomous driving is going to affect veh icles’ operation and \\nfuel economy. Barth, Boriboonsomsin and Wu [7] use results from  previous studies of \\nthe first two ([5 & 6] , to “identify the general areas where vehicle automation can \\npotentially impact energy and emissions” . Results show that energy consumption and \\ngas emissions are strongly influenced by a vehicle’s speed. Mor e specifically, they are \\nhigh at low speeds, as in case of traffic congestion, they flat ten out at average speeds, \\nand then rise up again when vehic les are moving at higher speed s.

The fa ctors are classified in \\nthree categories, (a) vehicle characteristics, (b) transportati on network and (c) con-\\nsumer choice, based on their field of influence. On terms of ve hicle characteristics, \\nauthors estimate that vehicle weight, performance and right-siz ing could have a positive \\nimpact on energy reduction, based on the fact that AVs are supp osed to diminish/reduce \\n- if not eliminate - car accidents, thus making all vehicles’ s afety equipment unneces-\\nsary. As energy consumption is proportionate to a vehicle’s wei ght, removing safety \\nequipment will result in much lighter and less fuel consuming c ars. Furthermore, the \\nregulation of a vehicle’s speed, through automatic control, and  the introduction of \\nsmaller sized vehicles, more appropriate to specific uses, woul d enhance all efforts to \\nweight reduction and thus energy consumption. \\nAs reported by [59]  the energy impacts of Light Duty Automated  Vehicles depend on \\nthe number of miles travelled by a vehicle, its performance and  consumer acceptance. \\nRegarding the vehicle’s performance and its effect on the envir onment, authors of [56], \\nafter reviewing literature, conclude that there are four factor s contributing to gaining \\nmaximum results: (a) Vehicle Operation, associated with eco-rou ting or eco-driving, \\n(b) electrification (c) vehicle design and (d) platooning.  \\nEco-driving is associated with au tomated acceleration and braki ng technologies ap-\\nplied on CAVs. Such technologies have the ability to reduce fue l consumption and, can \\nresult, according to [13] in a fuel consumption reduction of at  least 20%. Authors of \\n[24] state that eco-driving could reduce fuel use up to 20%, in  the case of aggressive \\ndrivers, and up to 15% in the case of less aggressive drivers. According to [42], as \\nmentioned in [2], fuel economy can be improved by a 4 to 10% th rough eco-driving. \\nOther studies present estimates of energy reduction: researcher s of [5] suggest that a \\nreduction of 10-20% in fuel consumption is possible, those of [ 10] state that a percent-\\nage of 13% is achievable, while results of (Chen, et al., 2017)  show greater benefits in \\nfuel consumption ranging between 30 to 45%. Platooning is also expected to increase \\nfuel savings, by reducing air re sistance (air drag) for cars fo llowing the leader car of \\nthe platoon. Platooning gains are greater for the vehicles in t he middle of the platoon \\nand become significantly smaller for the vehicles at the front or at the end.  Studies such \\nas the SARTRE project estimate a possible reduction of up to 20 % to fuel consumption \\ndue to platooning [50]. In [64] platooning benefits on energy r eduction are estimated to \\nbe somewhere between 3% and 25%, while a percentage of 10% is m entioned in [13].  ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='7 \\nVehicle design is also considered important when it comes to fu el consumption. Au-\\nthors of [38, 4, 36, 30, 12, 9], mention that lighter vehicles could decrease fuel con-\\nsumption and contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, as a n indirect effect. Given \\nthe fact that CAVs are expected to reduce crashes and improve o verall road safety, \\nsafety equipment would no longer be necessary, resulting in lig ht-weight vehicles, \\nwhich will consume less fuel. Such alterations in vehicle desig n are expected to be \\ngreater as the level of automation increases. Small vehicle mas s reduction in levels 1 to \\n3 and great for level 4, which may even  result in vehicles sha ped as “ ultralight, aero-\\ndynamic pods”  [2]. Based on scenario projections, authors of [42] estimated reductions \\nin fuel consumption between 4% to 7% in case the vehicle’s weig ht was reduced by \\n25%. An estimate of 6-7% reduction in fuel consumption is prese nted in [44], resulting \\nfrom a 10% weight reduction.  Changing fuel type, from gasoline to electricity, is assessed t o be another way of reduc-\\ning GHGs emissions [25, 64, 24, 29]. Studies on the environment al impacts of Electric \\nvehicles found in literature examine the possible outcomes conc erning GHG emissions \\nthrough the use of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), Ba ttery electric vehicles \\n(BEVs) or Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Environmental gains from electricity pow-\\nered vehicles depend both on the vehicle’s power consumption as  well as GHG emis-\\nsion reduction during battery production. Authors of (Hall & Lu tsey, 2018) compared \\nlife-cycle emissions of BEVs and PHEVs to those of a convention al European car. They \\nconcluded that both BEVs and PHEVs emit less GHGs than conventi onal cars with \\nBEVs being the less polluting of the two, producing up to 50% l ess GHGs through its \\nlife cycle compared to a conventional car. A possible further r eduction was suggested \\nto reach up to 41% through battery recycling and battery improv ements technology. \\nSimilar statements are to be found in (ICCT, 2018). In the repo rt it is stated that though \\nbattery manufacturing emissions play a significant role in the overall environmental \\ngain, benefits from the use of electricity as engine power vary  from 28 to 72% depend-\\ning on the power source.  Another indirect effect on the environment is through maximizin g routing efficiency. \\nBased on the fact that CAVs are equipped with technology enabli ng interaction with \\ninfrastructure systems or other vehicles and providing real-tim e information on conges-\\ntion levels, accidents etc, they could contribute to right deci sion making concerning \\nroute selection, thus avoiding traffic congestion and reducing emissions. In their re-\\nsearch, authors of [27] found that fuel consumption could be re duced up to 12% when \\nalgorithms, used for modeling route selection, aim at emissions  reduction. Though \\ntravel time and vehicle fleet can be increased through green ro ute selection, the overall \\noutcome on the environmental impact is assumed to be positive [ 67]. \\nOne of the most widely mentioned benefits of CAV implementation  is considered to be \\nthe reduction of traffic congestion. Being able to keep smaller  distances from each \\nother, CAV use is likely to increase road capacity and decrease  congestion levels. It is ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='8 \\nduring peak hours that congestion reaches the highest levels. I glinski and Babiak men-\\ntion in [32] that fuel consumption can be increased up to 50% d uring this time. As GHG \\nemissions and fuel consumption rise in congestion situations, a  decrease in traffic con-\\ngestion could result in a decrease in fuel consumption varying between 15% and 60%, \\ndepending on the AV penetration level [22, 54]. In the case of traffic congestion and \\ntraffic flow, the CAVs penetration level is of great importance , as “at low penetration \\nlevels the benefits of CAVs are likely to be constrained by the limitations of the existing vehicle fleet”  [16].  \\nAs mentioned in section 3, on demand mobility and carsharing ca n have a positive im-\\npact on GHS emissions especially when Autonomous technology is engaged. As au-\\nthors of [56] state:  “Shared mobility is an effective way to reduce VMT by combining \\ntrips that are temporally and spatially similar, generating many benefits including ef-ficiency improvements, fleet downsizing, congestion reduction, energy conservation, \\nand emissions alleviation” . Carsharing can contribute to fuel and gas emission reduc-\\ntion, by eliminating unoccupied vehicle time, representing almo st 90% of a vehicles’ \\nlifetime, and reducing the vehicle fleet. Martin and Shasheen e stimated a reduction of \\n9 to 13 vehicles per vehicle sharing [37] while Greenbalt and S axena point out that \\nAutonomous Taxis could help drop down average energy consumptio n, through the use \\nof right-sized vehicles and car-sharing, by 3% [25]. Barcham [4 ] notices that it is of \\ngreat importance to adopt policies that would avert possible in crease of the Vehicles’ \\nmiles travelled (VMT), as it is that increase that would preven t any positive climate \\nimpact of the AVs’ implementation [22, 67, 2] .  However, many researchers point out that the risk of Vehicle Au tomation can actually \\nresult in an increase of vehicle fleet number and a consequent increase in fuel consump-\\ntion and GHG emissions. Although a shift to shared or on-demand  mobility is desired \\nor even necessary, the possibility of private-owned vehicle pat terns prevailing could \\nlead to an enlargement of the vehicle fleet number, more VMTs, resulting to an increase \\nin both fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Furthermore, it is suggested that when \\nAVs are on the road there is a possibility that VMT will increa se because of the increase \\nof road users like people with disabilities, young and elderly people. A possible increase \\nin VMT could eventually lead to an increase in gas emissions an d fuel consumption.  \\nConsumer choice is crucial when it comes to both AVs penetratio n levels and adapta-\\ntion of shared mobility models. Authors of [47] conducted an on line survey aiming at \\ndiscovering user driving preferences and future travel modes. T aking into consideration \\nthat human behavior can dramatically alter potential benefits o f AVs’ implementation, \\nspecifically those originating from reduced fleet number, autho rs performed a research \\nin order to include human driving behavior as a significant fac tor. Based on the answers \\nof 302 participants, the authors analyze user preferences on pr ivate car use, automated \\nprivate car use, traditional carsharing, automated carsharing a nd public transport. Alt-\\nhough it is widely discussed in literature that the implementat ion of AVs is going to \\npromote car sharing, results of the research show that private car use is most preferred, ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='9 \\nfollowed by automated private car and public transport, while a t the same time carshar-\\ning, both automated  and conventional, are the least preferred.  Consequently, authors \\ndoubt the fact that autonomous driving will encourage the reduc tion of vehicle fleet and \\nall the environmental positive effects coming from it and sugge st that autonomous car-\\nsharing is the way of achieving the best positive effects.  \\nAll key factors that are to be found in literature are summariz ed in the following \\ndiagram and categorized based on which component they refer to,  vehicles, transporta-\\ntion network or user. \\n \\n \\n5 Discussion \\n  Based on existing literature, CAVs are expected to bring noti ceable changes to the \\ntransportation system and through them a reduction of the envir onmental impacts of \\nthe transportation sector. Many key factors will contribute to the realization of these \\nchanges. Studies show that expected reduction in CO 2 emissions varies between 7 and \\n94%, depending on the factors taken into consideration. GHG emi ssions are also ex-\\npected to decrease at a lower rate though, varying between 5 an d 60%, while fuel con-\\nsumption seems to be the most influenced with a reduction rate between 30 and 90%.  \\nOne of the most important key factors affecting the environment al impact of CAVs, is \\nconsidered to be their penetration level. Simulation studies an d theoretical researches \\nshow that at lower levels of CAV penetration, positive effects tend to be less remarkable \\nand become greater as the penetration rate rises. Penetration l evel affects other key \\nfactors as well, with congestion reduction being one of them. I f electrification of CAVs \\nis taken into consideration along with high penetration levels,  reduction of traffic con-\\ngestion is estimated to reach its maximum rate.  \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='10 \\nThough existing studies cover to a great extent the aspects of environmental impact of \\nCAVs, more research is needed, especially in relation to public  opinion on CAVs and \\nmarket penetration.

Fur thermore, new studies \\nshould be conducted taking into consideration all the key facto rs and combinations of \\nthem in order to detect any controversies between them. Finally , it is important that \\navailable real world data be used as to have a more realistic e valuation of the upcom-\\ning/potential positive effects.  \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='11 \\n6 Bibliography \\n \\n1.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientiﬁc\\nevidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\\nChange (UNFCCC), including the ﬁrst global stocktake under the Paris Agreement that will conclude at COP28\\nin December 2023. Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information\\non key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human inﬂuence on the global climate system.\\nHowever, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information\\ngap between report cycles.\\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working\\nGroup One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related\\nto forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas\\nconcentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the Earth’s energy imbalance, warming attributed\\nto human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of\\nthis effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate\\nindicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, Smith et al., 2023a). As they\\nare traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and\\nhelp convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\\nThe indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4]◦C averaged over the 2013–2022\\ndecade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6]◦C in 2022. Over the 2013–2022 period, human-induced warming has been increas-\\ning at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2◦C per decade. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of\\ngreenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ±5.3 GtCO 2e over the last decade, as well as reductions\\nin the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have\\nslowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s\\ndecade could track a change of direction for human inﬂuence on climate.\\nEarth Syst.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update 2297\\n1 Introduction\\nIncreased greenhouse gas concentrations combined with re-\\nductions in aerosol pollution have led to rapid increases\\nin human-induced effective radiative forcing, which has in\\nturn led to atmosphere, land, cryosphere and ocean warming\\n(Gulev et al., 2021). This in turn has led to an intensiﬁca-\\ntion of many weather and climate extremes, particularly more\\nfrequent and more intense hot extremes, and heavy precipi-\\ntation across most regions of the world (Seneviratne et al.,\\n2021). Given the speed of recent change, and the need for\\nevidence-based decision-making, this Indicators of Global\\nClimate Change (IGCC) update assembles the latest scien-\\ntiﬁc understanding on the current state and evolution of the\\nclimate system and of human inﬂuence to support policy-\\nmakers whilst the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\\nChange (IPCC) assessment is under preparation. This ﬁrst\\nannual update is focused on indicators related to heating\\nof the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emis-\\nsions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the\\nremaining carbon budget. In future years, this effort could\\nbe expanded to encompass other indicators, including global\\nprecipitation changes and related extremes.\\nWe adopt the Global Carbon Budget ethos of a\\ncommunity-wide inclusive effort that synthesises work\\nfrom across a large and diverse global scientiﬁc community\\nin a timely fashion (Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). Like the\\nGlobal Carbon Budget, this initiative arises from the inter-\\nnational science community to establish a knowledge base to\\nsupport policy debate and action to meet the Paris Agreement\\ntemperature goal.\\nThis update complements other international efforts un-\\nder the auspices of the Global Climate Observing Sys-\\ntem (GCOS) and the World Meteorological Organization\\n(WMO). Annual state-of-the-climate reports are released by\\nthe WMO which use much of the same data analysed here\\nfor surface temperature and energy budget trends. The Bul-\\nletin of American Meteorological Society (BAMS) releases\\nannual state-of-the-climate reports covering many essential\\nvariables including temperature and greenhouse gas concen-\\ntrations. However, these reports focus on statistics from\\nthe previous year and make slightly different choices over\\ndatasets and analysis compared to the IPCC (see Sect. 5).\\nThe Global Carbon Project publishes updated carbon diox-\\nide datasets which are used directly in this report. There is\\nno similarly structured activity that provides all the neces-\\nsary datasets to update the assessment of human inﬂuence on\\nglobal surface temperature annually.\\nThe update is based on methodologies for key climate indi-\\ncators assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)\\nof the physical science basis of climate change (Working\\nGroup One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2\\nof the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned\\nwith the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Find-\\nable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for re-producibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et\\nal., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of\\nthe science and methodologies – we do not attempt to repro-\\nduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments\\nhere.\\nThe IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5◦C\\n(SR1.5), published in 2018, provided an assessment of the\\nlevel of human-induced warming and cumulative emissions\\nto date (Allen et al., 2018) and the remaining carbon bud-\\nget (Rogelj et al., 2018) to support the evidence base on how\\nthe world is progressing in terms of meeting aspects of the\\nParis Agreement. The AR6 WGI Report, published in 2021,\\nassessed past, current and future changes of these and other\\nkey global climate indicators, as well as undertaking an as-\\nsessment of the Earth’s energy budget. It also updated its ap-\\nproach for estimating human-induced warming and global\\nwarming level. In AR6 WGI and here, reaching a level of\\nglobal warming is deﬁned as the global surface temperature\\nchange, averaged over a 20-year period, exceeding a par-\\nticular level of global warming, for example, 1.5◦C global\\nwarming. Given the current rates of change and the likeli-\\nhood of reaching 1.5◦C of global warming in the ﬁrst half\\nof the 2030s (Lee et al., 2021, 2023; Riahi et al., 2022), it\\nis important to have robust, trusted and also timely climate\\nindicators in the public domain to form an evidence base for\\neffective science-based decision-making.\\nWhen making their assessments, authors of IPCC reports\\nassess published literature but also apply established pub-\\nlished analysis methods to assessed datasets, such as the\\ndataset produced by the latest climate model intercompar-\\nison projects (Lee et al., 2021). The authors combine and\\nanalyse both model and observational data as part of their\\nexpert assessment, making assessments of the trustworthi-\\nness and error characteristics of different datasets. It is this\\nsynthetic analysis by IPCC authors that derives the estimates\\nof key climate indicators. Wherever possible, these same as-\\nsessed methodological approaches are implemented here to\\nprovide the updates with variations clearly ﬂagged and doc-\\numented. The same approach, using the same datasets (up-\\ndated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI, was\\nused in the AR6 Synthesis Report (2023) (AR6 SYR; Lee\\net al., 2023) to provide an updated assessment of the latest\\natmospheric well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations (up\\nto 2021) and decadal average change in global surface tem-\\nperature (+1.15◦C [1.00–1.25◦C] in 2013–2022 for global\\nsurface temperature). However, the assessment of human-\\ninduced warming was not updated (and therefore only covers\\nwarming up to the decade 2010–2019), nor was the remain-\\ning carbon budget updated, so the related information in the\\nAR6 SYR report remained based on data up to the end of\\n2019.\\nThe indicators in this ﬁrst annual update give important\\ninsights into the magnitude and the pace of global warming.\\nThis paper provides the basis for a dashboard of climate in-\\ndicators grounded in IPCC methodologies and directly trace-\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023 Earth Syst.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update\\nable to reports published as part of the AR6 cycle. We employ\\ndatasets that can be updated on a regular basis between the\\npublication of IPCC reports. Note that there are other similar\\ninitiatives underway to update other AR6 cycle products; for\\nexample, the evolution of the WGI Interactive Atlas (Gutiér-\\nrez et al., 2021) is being developed under the Copernicus Cli-\\nmate Change Service (C3S) and has potential connections\\nand synergies with this initiative that will be explored in the\\nfuture.\\nOur longer-term ambition is to rigorously track both cli-\\nmate system change and methodological improvements be-\\ntween IPCC report cycles, thereby building consistency and\\nawareness. An example of why tracking methodological\\nchange is important was the updated estimate for historic\\nwarming (the increase in global surface temperature from\\n1850–1900 to 1986–2005). This was 0.08 [ −0.01 to 0.12]◦C\\nhigher in the AR6 than in the ﬁfth assessment report (AR5)\\nand SR1.5. Datasets and methods of evaluating global tem-\\nperature changes altered between the AR5 and AR6, leading\\nto a small shift in the historical temperature. This was re-\\nﬂected in changes between AR5 and AR6, whereas SR1.5\\nmostly relied on methodologies from AR5 (see AR6 WGI\\nCross Chap. Box 2.3, Gulev et al., 2021). Annual updates\\nprovide indications of possible future methodological shifts\\nthat subsequent IPCC reports may make as science advances\\nand can detail their impact on perceived trends.\\nThe update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2)\\nand greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used\\nto develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing\\n(Sect. 4). Observations of global surface temperature change\\n(Sect. 5) and Earth’s energy imbalance (Sect. 6) are key\\nglobal indicators of a warming world. The global surface\\ntemperature change is formally attributed to human activity\\nin Sect. 7, which tracks human-induced warming. Section 8\\nupdates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant tem-\\nperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-\\nscale indicators associated with climate extremes of maxi-\\nmum land surface temperatures.\\nAn important purpose of the exercise is to make these indi-\\ncators widely available and understood. Plans for a web dash-\\nboard are discussed in Sect. 10 and code and data availability\\nin Sect. 11, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 12. Data\\nare available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192\\n(Smith et al., 2023a).\\n2 Emissions\\nHistoric emissions from human activity were assessed in\\nboth AR6 WGI and WGIII. Chapter 5 of WGI assessed\\nCO2and CH 4emissions in the context of the carbon cycle\\n(Canadell et al., 2021). Chapter 6 of WGI assessed emis-\\nsions in the context of understanding the climate and air\\nquality impacts of short-lived climate forcers (Szopa et al.,\\n2021). Chapter 2 of WGIII, published 1 year later (Dhakalet al., 2022), looked at the sectoral sources of emissions and\\ngave the most up-to-date understanding of the current level of\\nemissions. This section bases its methods and data on those\\nemployed in this WGIII chapter.\\n2.1 Methods of estimating greenhouse gas emissions\\nchanges\\nLike in AR6 WGIII, net GHG emissions in this paper re-\\nfer to releases of GHGs from anthropogenic sources minus\\nremovals by anthropogenic sinks, for those species of gases\\nthat are reported under the common reporting format of the\\nUNFCCC. This includes CO 2emissions from fossil fuels\\nand industry (CO 2-FFI); net CO 2emissions from land use,\\nland-use change and forestry (CO 2-LULUCF); CH 4; N2O;\\nand ﬂuorinated gas (F-gas) emissions. CO 2-FFI mainly com-\\nprises fossil-fuel combustion emissions, as well as emis-\\nsions from industrial processes such as cement production.\\nThis excludes biomass and biofuel use by industry. CO 2-\\nLULUCF is mainly driven by deforestation but also includes\\nanthropogenic removals on land from afforestation and re-\\nforestation, emissions from logging and forest degradation,\\nand emissions and removals in shifting cultivation cycles, as\\nwell as emissions and removals from other land-use change\\nand land management activities, including peat burning and\\ndrainage. The non-CO 2GHGs – CH 4, N2O and F-gas emis-\\nsions – are linked to the fossil-fuel extraction, agriculture,\\nindustry and waste sectors.\\nGlobal regulatory conventions have led to a twofold\\ncategorisation of F-gas emissions (also known as halo-\\ngenated gases). Under UNFCCC accounting, countries\\nrecord emissions of hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), perﬂuoro-\\ncarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexaﬂuoride (SF6) and nitrogen tri-\\nﬂuoride (NF3) – hereinafter “UNFCCC F-gases”. However,\\nnational inventories tend to exclude halons, chloroﬂuorocar-\\nbons (CFCs) and hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs) – here-\\ninafter “ODS (ozone-depleting substance) F-gases” – as they\\nhave been initially regulated under the Montreal Protocol and\\nits amendments. In line with the WGIII assessment, ODS\\nF-gases and other substances, including ozone and aerosols,\\nare not included in our GHG emissions reporting but are in-\\ncluded in subsequent assessments of concentrations, effec-\\ntive radiative forcing, human-induced warming, carbon bud-\\ngets and climate impacts in line with the WGI assessment.\\nThere are also varying conventions used to quantify CO 2-\\nLULUCF ﬂuxes. These include the use of bookkeeping mod-\\nels, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and the na-\\ntional inventory approach (Pongratz et al., 2021). Each dif-\\nfers in terms of their applied system boundaries and deﬁ-\\nnitions and is not directly comparable. However, efforts to\\n“translate” between bookkeeping estimates and national in-\\nventories using DGVMs have demonstrated a degree of con-\\nsistency between the varying approaches (Friedlingstein et\\nal., 2022a; Grassi et al., 2023).\\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2295–2327, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\copernicus-report.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='P . M. Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update 2299\\nEach category of GHG emissions included here is covered\\nby varying primary sources and datasets. Although many\\ndatasets cover individual categories, few extend across multi-\\nple categories, and only a minority have frequent and timely\\nupdate schedules. Notable datasets include the Global Car-\\nbon Budget (GCB; Friedlingstein et al., 2022b), which cov-\\ners CO 2-FFI and CO 2-LULUCF; the Emissions Database for\\nGlobal Atmospheric Research (EDGAR; Crippa et al., 2022)\\nand the Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model for probabilis-\\ntic Assessment of emissions Paths (PRIMAP-hist; Gütschow\\net al., 2016; Gütschow and Pﬂüger 2023), which cover CO 2-\\nFFI, CH 4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases; and the Commu-\\nnity Emissions Data System (CEDS; O’Rourke et al., 2021),\\nwhich covers CO 2-FFI, CH 4, and N 2O. As detailed below,\\nnot all these datasets were employed in this update.\\nIn AR6 WGIII, total net GHG emissions were calculated\\nas the sum of CO 2-FFI, CH 4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases\\nfrom EDGAR and net CO 2-LULUCF emissions from the\\nGCB. Net CO 2-LULUCF emissions followed the GCB con-\\nvention and were derived from the average of three book-\\nkeeping models (Hansis et al., 2015; Houghton and Nas-\\nsikas, 2017; Gasser et al., 2020). Version 6 of EDGAR was\\nused (with a fast-track methodology applied for the ﬁnal year\\nof data – 2019), alongside the 2020 version of the GCB\\n(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). CO 2-equivalent emissions were\\ncalculated using global warming potentials with a 100-year\\ntime horizon from AR6 WGI Chap. 7 (Forster et al., 2021).\\nUncertainty ranges were based on a comparative assessment\\nof available data and expert judgement, corresponding to a\\n90 % conﬁdence interval (Minx et al., 2021): ±8 % for CO 2-\\nFFI,±70 % for CO 2-LULUCF,±30 % for CH 4and F-gases,\\nand±60 % for N 2O (note that the GCB assesses 1 standard\\ndeviation uncertainty for CO 2-FFI as±5 % and for CO 2-\\nLULUCF as±2.6 GtCO 2; Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). The\\ntotal uncertainty was summed in quadrature, assuming in-\\ndependence of estimates per species/source. Reﬂecting these\\nuncertainties, AR6 WGIII reported emissions to two signiﬁ-\\ncant ﬁgures only. Uncertainties in GWP100 metrics were not\\napplied (Minx et al., 2021).\\nThis analysis tracks the same compilation of GHGs as in\\nAR6 WGIII. We follow the same approach for estimating un-\\ncertainties and CO 2-equivalent emissions. We also use the\\nsame type of data sources but make important changes to\\nthe speciﬁc selection of data sources to further improve the\\nquality of the data, as suggested in the knowledge gap dis-\\ncussion of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022). Instead of\\nusing EDGAR data (which are now available as version 7),\\nwe use GCB data for CO 2-FFI, PRIMAP-hist data for CH 4\\nand N 2O, and atmospheric concentrations with best-estimate\\nlifetimes for UNFCCC F-gas emissions (Hodnebrog et al.,\\n2020). As in AR6 WGIII we use GCB for net CO 2-LULUCF\\nemissions, taking the average of three bookkeeping models.\\nThere are three reasons for these speciﬁc data choices.\\nFirst, national greenhouse gas emissions inventories tend\\nto use improved, higher-tier methods for estimating emis-sions ﬂuxes than global inventories such as EDGAR or\\nCEDS (Dhakal et al., 2022; Minx et al., 2021). As GCB\\nand PRIMAP-hist integrate the most recent national inven-\\ntory submissions to the UNFCCC, selecting these databases\\nmakes best use of country-level improvements in data-\\ngathering infrastructures. Second, comprehensive reporting\\nof F-gas emissions has remained challenging in national in-\\nventories and may exclude some military applications (see\\nMinx et al., 2021; Dhakal et al., 2022). However, F-gases\\nare entirely anthropogenic substances, and their concentra-\\ntions can be measured effectively and reliably in the atmo-\\nsphere. We therefore follow the AR6 WGI approach in mak-\\ning use of direct atmospheric observations. Third, the choice\\nof GCB data for CO 2-FFI means we can integrate its projec-\\ntion of that year’s CO 2emissions at the time of publication\\n(i.e. for 2022). No other dataset except GCB provides pro-\\njections of CO 2emissions on this time frame. At this point\\nin the publication cycle (mid-year), the other chosen sources\\nprovide data points with a 2-year time lag (i.e. for 2021).\\nWhile these data choices inform our overall assessment of\\nGHG emissions, we provide a comparison across datasets for\\neach emissions category, as well as between our estimates\\nand an estimate derived from AR6 WGIII-like databases (i.e.\\nEDGAR for CO 2-FFI and non-CO 2GHG emissions, GCB\\nfor CO 2-LULUCF).\\n2.2 Updated global greenhouse gas emissions\\nTotal global GHG emissions reached 55 ±5.2 GtCO 2e\\nin 2021. The main contributing sources were CO 2-FFI\\n(37±3 GtCO 2), CO 2-LULUCF (3.9±2.8 GtCO 2), CH 4\\n(8.9±2.7 GtCO 2e), N 2O (2.9±1.8 GtCO 2e) and F-gas\\nemissions (2±0.59 GtCO 2e). GHG emissions rebounded in\\n2021, following a single-year decline during the COVID-\\n19-induced lockdowns of 2020. Prior to this event in 2019,\\nemissions were 55±5.4 GtCO 2e – i.e. almost the same level\\nas in 2021. Initial projections indicate that CO 2emissions\\nfrom fossil fuel and industry and land-use change remained\\nsimilar in 2022, at 37 ±3 and 3.9±2.8 GtCO 2, respectively\\n(Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). Note that ODS F-gases such\\nas chloroﬂuorocarbons and hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons are ex-\\ncluded from national GHG emissions inventories. For con-\\nsistency with AR6, they are also excluded here. Including\\nthem here would increase total global GHG emissions by\\n1.6 GtCO 2e in 2021.\\nAverage GHG emissions for the decade 2012–2021 were\\n54±5.3 GtCO 2e. Average decadal GHG emissions have in-\\ncreased steadily since the 1970s across all major groups of\\nGHGs, driven primarily by increasing CO 2emissions from\\nfossil fuel and industry but also rising emissions of CH 4and\\nN2O. UNFCCC F-gas emissions have grown more rapidly\\nthan other greenhouse gases reported under the UNFCCC but\\nfrom low levels. By contrast, ODS F-gas emissions have de-\\nclined substantially since the 1990s. Both the magnitude and\\ntrend of CO 2emissions from land-use change remain highly\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023 Earth Syst. Sci.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update\\nuncertain, with the latest data indicating an average net ﬂux\\nbetween 4–5 GtCO 2yr−1for the past few decades.\\nAR6 WGIII reported total net anthropogenic emissions of\\n59±6.6 GtCO 2e in 2019 and decadal average emissions of\\n56±6.0 GtCO 2e from 2010–2019. By comparison, our es-\\ntimates here for the AR6 period sum to 55 ±5.4 GtCO 2e\\nin 2019 and 53±5.3 GtCO 2e for the same decade (2010–\\n2019). The difference between these ﬁgures, including the\\nreduced relative uncertainty range, is partly driven by the\\nsubstantial revision in GCB CO 2-LULUCF estimates be-\\ntween the 2020 version (used in AR6 WGIII) of 6.6 GtCO 2\\nand the 2022 version (used here) of 4.6 GtCO 2. The main\\nreason for this downward revision comes from updated es-\\ntimates of agricultural areas by the FAO and uses multi-\\nannual land-cover maps from satellite remote sensing, lead-\\ning to lower emissions from cropland expansion, particu-\\nlarly in the tropical regions. It is important to note that this\\nchange is not a reﬂection of changed and improved method-\\nology per se but an update of the resulting estimation due\\nto updates in the available input data. Second, there are rela-\\ntively small changes resulting from improvements in datasets\\nsince AR6, with the direction of changes depending on the\\nconsidered gases. CH 4accounts for the largest of these at\\n−1.8 GtCO 2e in 2019, which is related to the switch from\\nEDGAR in AR6 to PRIMAP-hist in this study. EDGAR\\nestimates considerably higher CH 4emissions – from fugi-\\ntive fossil sources, as well as the livestock, rice cultivation\\nand waste sectors – compared to country-reported data using\\nhigher tier methods, as compiled in PRIMAP-hist. Generally,\\nuncertainty in these sectors is relatively high as calculations\\nare based on activity data and assumed emissions factors\\nwhich are hard to determine and vary greatly over countries.\\nDifferences in the remaining gases for 2019 are relatively\\nsmall in magnitude (increases in N 2O (+0.18 GtCO 2e) and\\nUNFCCC-F-gases (+0.48 GtCO 2e) and decreases in CO2-\\nFFI (−0.8 GtCO 2e)). Overall, excluding the change due to\\nCO2-LULUCF and CH 4, they impact the total GHG emis-\\nsions estimate by−0.14 GtCO 2e.\\nNew literature not available at the time of the AR6 sug-\\ngests that increases in atmospheric methane concentrations\\nare also driven by methane emissions from wetland changes\\nresulting from climate change (e.g. Basu et al., 2022; Peng et\\nal., 2022; Nisbet et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Such car-\\nbon cycle feedbacks are not considered here, as we focus on\\nestimates of emissions resulting directly from human activi-\\nties.\\n2.3 Non-methane short-lived climate forcers\\nIn addition to GHG emissions, we provide an update of an-\\nthropogenic emissions of non-methane short-lived climate\\nforcers (SLCFs) (SO 2, black carbon (BC), organic carbon\\n(OC), NO x, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO and\\nNH 3). HFCs are considered in Sect. 2.2. Updating emis-\\nsions of many short-lived climate forcing agents to 2022based on established datasets is not possible as compiling\\nglobal data can take several years. Yet, as SLCF emissions\\nare needed in this paper to update effective radiative forcing\\n(ERF) estimates through 2022, updated emission datasets,\\nwhere they are available, are combined with projected data\\nto make SLCF emission time series complete.\\nAs in Dhakal et al. (2022), sectoral emissions of SLCFs are\\nderived from two sources. For fossil fuel, industrial, waste\\nand agricultural sectors, we use the CEDS dataset that pro-\\nvided SLCF emissions for the Coupled Model Intercompar-\\nison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) (Hoesly et al., 2018). CEDS\\nprovides global emissions totals from 1750 to 2019 in its\\nmost recent version (O’Rourke et al., 2021). No CEDS emis-\\nsions data are available yet beyond 2019. As a ﬁrst esti-\\nmate, the SLCF emissions time series are extrapolated to\\n2022 using the “two-year blip” scenario (Forster et al., 2020)\\nof global emissions suppressed by the economic slowdown\\ndue to COVID-19. These projections are proxy estimates\\nfrom Google and Apple mobility data over 2020 and assume\\na slow return to pre-pandemic emissions activity levels by\\n2022. Other near-real-time emissions estimates covering the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic era tend to show less of an emissions\\nreduction than the two-year blip scenario (Guevara et al.,\\n2023). It should be stressed that accurate quantiﬁcation of\\nSLCF emissions during this period is not possible.\\nWe do not explicitly account for the introduction of strict\\nfuel sulfur controls brought in by the International Mar-\\nitime Organization on 1 January 2020, which was expected\\nto reduce SO 2emissions from the global shipping sector\\nby 8.5 Tg against a pre-COVID baseline (around 10 % of\\n2019 total SO 2emissions). SO 2reductions from shipping are\\npartly accounted for in the proxy activity dataset, and includ-\\ning a speciﬁc shipping adjustment may double-count emis-\\nsions reductions.\\nFor biomass-burning SLCF emissions, we follow\\nAR6 WGIII (Dhakal et al., 2022) and use the Global Fire\\nEmissions Dataset (GFED; Randerson et al., 2017) for 1997\\nto 2022, with the dataset extended back to 1750 for CMIP6\\n(van Marle et al., 2017). Estimates from 2017 to 2022 are\\nprovisional. The potential for both sources of emissions\\ndata to be updated in future versions exists, particularly in\\nlight of a forthcoming update to CEDS and quantiﬁcation\\nof shipping sector SO 2reductions. Other natural emissions,\\nwhich are important for gauging some SLCF concentrations,\\nare considered as constant in the context of calculating\\nconcentrations and ERF.\\nEstimated emissions used here are based on a combina-\\ntion of GFED emissions for biomass-burning emissions and\\nCEDS up until 2019 extended with the two-year blip scenario\\nfor fossil, agricultural, industrial and waste sectors. Under\\nthis scenario, emissions of all SLCFs are reduced in 2022\\nrelative to 2019 (Table 2). As described in Sect. 4, this has\\nimplications for several categories of anthropogenic radia-\\ntive forcing. Trends in SLCFs emissions are spatially het-\\nerogeneous (Szopa et al., 2021), with strong shifts in the\\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update\\ngeographical distribution of emissions over the 2010–2019\\ndecade. Very different lockdown measures have been applied\\nfor COVID around the world, resulting in various lengths and\\nintensities of activity reductions and effects on air pollutant\\nemissions (Sokhi et al., 2021). SLCF emissions have been\\nseen to return to their pre-COVID levels by 2022 in some re-\\ngions, sometimes with a rebound effect, but not in all (Putaud\\net al., 2023; Lonsdale and Sun, 2023), but quantiﬁcation at\\nthe global scale is not yet available.\\nUncertainties associated with these emission estimates are\\ndifﬁcult to quantify. From the non-biomass-burning sectors\\nthey are estimated to be smallest for SO 2(±14 %), largest\\nfor black carbon (BC) (a factor of 2) and intermediate for\\nother species (Smith et al., 2011; Bond et al., 2013; Hoesly et\\nal., 2018). Uncertainties are also likely to increase both back-\\nwards in time (Hoesly et al., 2018) and again in the most re-\\ncent years. The estimates of non-biomass-burning emissions\\nfor 2020, 2021 and 2022 are highly uncertain, owing to the\\nuse of proxy activity data, scenario extension and the impact\\nof sulfur controls in the shipping sector. Future updates of\\nCEDS are expected to include uncertainties (Hoesly et al.,\\n2018). Even though trends over recent years are uncertain,\\nthe general decline in some SLCF emissions derived is sup-\\nported by aerosol optical depth measurements (e.g. Quaas et\\nal., 2022).\\n3 Well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations\\nAR6 WGI assessed well-mixed GHG concentrations in\\nChap. 2 (Gulev et al., 2021) and additionally provided a\\ndataset of concentrations of 52 well-mixed GHGs from 1750\\nto 2019 in its Annex III (IPCC, 2021c). Footnotes in AR6\\nSYR updated CO 2, CH 4and N 2O concentrations to 2021\\n(Lee et al., 2023). In this update, we extended the record to\\n2022 for all 52 gases.\\nOzone is an important greenhouse gas with strong regional\\nvariation both in the stratosphere and troposphere (Szopa et\\nal., 2021). Its ERF arising from its regional distribution is\\nassessed in Sect. 4 but following AR6 convention is not in-\\ncluded with the GHGs discussed here. Other non-methane\\nSLCFs are heterogeneously distributed in the atmosphere\\nand are also not typically reported in terms of a globally av-\\neraged concentration. Globally averaged concentrations for\\nthese are normally model-derived, supplemented by local\\nmonitoring networks and satellite data (Szopa et al., 2021).\\nAs in AR6, CO 2concentrations are taken from the NOAA\\nGlobal Monitoring Laboratory (GML) and updated through\\n2022 (Lan et al., 2023a). Here, CO 2is reported on the\\nupdated WMO-CO2-X2019 scale, whereas in AR6, values\\nwere reported on the WMO-CO2-X2007 scale. This im-\\nproved calibration increases CO 2concentrations by around\\n0.2 ppm (Hall et al., 2021). In AR6, CH 4and N 2O were re-\\nported as the average from NOAA and the Advanced Global\\nAtmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) global networks.For 2022, as updated AGAGE data are not currently avail-\\nable, we used only NOAA data (Lan et al., 2023b) and multi-\\nplied N 2O by 1.0007 to be consistent with a NOAA–AGAGE\\naverage. NOAA CH 4in 2022 was used without adjustment\\nsince the NOAA and AGAGE global CH 4means are con-\\nsistent within 2 ppb. Mixing ratio uncertainties for 2022 are\\nassumed to be similar to 2019, and we adopt the same uncer-\\ntainties as assessed in AR6 WGI.\\nMany halogenated greenhouse gases are reported on a\\nglobal mean basis from NOAA and/or AGAGE until 2020\\nor 2021 (SF 6is available in the NOAA dataset up to 2022).\\nWhere both NOAA and AGAGE data are used for the same\\ngas, we take a mean of the two datasets. Where both networks\\nare used and the last full year of data availability is different,\\nthe difference between the dataset mean and the dataset with\\nthe longer time series in this last year is used as an additive\\noffset to the dataset with the longer time series. Some obvi-\\nous inconsistencies are removed such as sudden changes in\\nconcentrations when missing data are reported as zero.\\nSome of the more minor halogenated gases are not part\\nof the NOAA or AGAGE operational network and are cur-\\nrently only reported in literature sources until 2019 or pos-\\nsibly 2015 (Droste et al., 2020; Laube et al., 2014; Schoe-\\nnenberger et al., 2015; Simmonds et al., 2017; V ollmer et al.,\\n2018). Concentrations of gases where 2022 data are not yet\\navailable are extrapolated forwards to 2022 using the average\\ngrowth rate over the last 5 years of available data. These as-\\nsumptions have an imperceptible effect on the total ERF as-\\nsessed in Sect. 4, whereas excluding these gases would have\\nan impact.\\nThe global surface mean mixing ratios of CO 2, CH 4and\\nN2O in 2022 were 417.1 [ ±0.4] ppm, 1911.9 [±3.3] ppb and\\n335.9 [±0.4] ppb. Concentrations of all three major GHGs\\nhave increased from 2019 values reported in AR6 WGI,\\nwhich were 410.1 [±0.36] ppm for CO 2, 1866.3 [±3.2] ppb\\nfor CH 4and 332.1 [±0.7] ppb for N 2O. CO 2concentrations\\nin 2019 are updated to 410.3 ppm using the new WMO-\\nCO2-X2019 scale adopted here. Concentrations of most cat-\\negories of halogenated GHGs have increased from 2019 to\\n2022: from 109.4 to 114.2 ppt on a CF 4-equivalent scale for\\nPFCs, 237.1 to 287.2 ppt on an HFC-134a-equivalent scale\\nfor HFCs, 9.9 to 11.0 ppt for SF 6and 2.1 to 2.8 ppt for NF 3.\\nOnly Montreal Protocol halogenated GHGs have decreased\\nin concentration, from 1031.9 ppt in 2019 to 1016.6 ppt in\\n2022 on a CFC-12-equivalent scale, demonstrating the con-\\ntinued success of the Montreal Protocol. Although even here,\\nconcentrations of some minor CFCs are rising (see also West-\\nern et al., 2023). In this update we employ AR6-derived un-\\ncertainty estimates and do not perform a new assessment. Ta-\\nble S1 in Sect. S3 of the Supplement shows speciﬁc updated\\nconcentrations for all the GHGs considered.\\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Chapter 7 focussed on assessing ERF\\nfrom changes in atmospheric concentrations; it also sup-\\nported estimates of ERF in Chap. 6 that attributed forc-\\ning to speciﬁc precursor emissions (Szopa et al., 2021) and\\nalso generated the time history of ERF shown in AR6 WGI\\nFig. 2.10 and discussed in Chap. 2 (Gulev et al., 2021). Only\\nthe concentration-based estimates are updated this year. The\\nemission-based estimates relied on speciﬁc chemistry cli-\\nmate model integrations, and a consistent method of applying\\nupdates to these would need to be developed in the future.\\nEach IPCC report has successively updated both the\\nmethod of calculation and the time history of different warm-\\ning and cooling contributions, measured as ERFs. Both types\\nof updates have contributed to a signiﬁcantly changed forcing\\nestimate between successive reports. For example, Forster et\\nal. (2021) updated the methodology to exclude adjustments\\nrelated to land surface temperature from the forcing calcula-\\ntion, which generally increased estimates. At the same time\\nGHG levels increased, and the time history of aerosol forcing\\nwas revised, overall leading to a higher total ERF estimate in\\nAR6 compared to AR5. These IPCC updates ﬂow from an\\nassessment of varied literature and also rely on updates to\\nconcentrations and/or emissions.\\nThere is no published regularly updated total ERF in-\\ndicator outside of the IPCC process, although the Euro-\\npean Copernicus programme has trialled such a product\\n(Bellouin et al., 2020). For radiative forcing, NOAA annu-\\nally updates estimates for the main GHGs, calculating ra-\\ndiative forcing (RF) using the set of formulas to estimate\\nRFs from concentrations (Montzka, 2022). Updated RF for-\\nmulas were employed in AR6 (Forster et al., 2021), and these\\nupdated expressions are also employed here in the Supple-\\nment, Sect. S4.\\nThe ERF calculation follows the methodology used in\\nAR6 WGI (Smith et al., 2021). For each category of forcing,\\na 100 000-member probabilistic Monte Carlo ensemble is\\nsampled to span the assessed uncertainty range in each forc-ing. All uncertainties are reported as 5 %–95 % ranges and\\nprovided in square brackets. The only signiﬁcant method-\\nological change compared to AR6 is for the volcanic ERF es-\\ntimate. Firstly, the pre-industrial baseline data have been im-\\nproved by switching to a new longer record of stratospheric\\naerosol optical depth before 1750 (Sigl et al., 2022). Sec-\\nondly, choices have also been made to include the January\\n2022 eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai as an excep-\\ntional positive ERF perturbation from the increase in strato-\\nspheric water vapour (Millán et al., 2022; Sellito et al., 2022;\\nJenkins et al., 2023). The methods are all detailed in the Sup-\\nplement, Sect. S4.\\nThe summary results for the anthropogenic constituents of\\nERF and solar irradiance in 2022 relative to 1750 are shown\\nin Fig. 2a. In Table 3 these are summarised alongside the\\nequivalent ERFs from AR6 (1750–2019) and AR5 (1750–\\n2011). Figure 2b shows the time evolution of ERF from 1750\\nto 2022.\\nTotal anthropogenic ERF has increased to 2.91 [2.19 to\\n3.63] W m−2in 2022 relative to 1750, compared to 2.72\\n[1.96 to 3.48] W m−2for 2019 relative to 1750 in AR6. The\\nmain contributions to this increase are from increases in\\ngreenhouse gas concentrations and a reduction in the mag-\\nnitude of aerosol forcing. Decadal trends in ERF have in-\\ncreased markedly and are now over 0.6 W m−2per decade.\\nThese are discussed further in the discussion and conclusions\\n(Sect. 12).\\nThe ERF from well-mixed GHGs is 3.45 [3.14 to\\n3.75] W m−2for 1750–2022, of which 2.25 W m−2is from\\nCO2, 0.56 W m−2from CH 4, 0.22 W m−2from N 2O and\\n0.41 W m−2from halogenated gases. This is an increase from\\n3.32 [3.03 to 3.61] W m−2for 1750–2019 in AR6. ERFs\\nfrom CO 2, CH 4and N 2O have all increased since the AR6\\nWG1 assessment for 1750–2019, owing to increases in at-\\nmospheric concentrations.\\nThe total aerosol ERF (sum of the ERF from aerosol–\\nradiation interactions (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud inter-\\nactions (ERFaci)) for 1750–2022 is −0.98 [−1.58 to\\n−0.40] W m−2compared to−1.06 [−1.71 to−0.41] W m−2\\nassessed for 1750–2019 in AR6 WG1.

The largest contributions to ERFari are from\\nSO2(primary source of sulfate aerosol; −0.21 W m−2),\\nBC (+0.12 W m−2), OC (−0.04 W m−2) and NH 3(primary\\nsource of nitrate aerosol; −0.03 W m−2). ERFari is not weak-\\nening as fast as ERFaci due to reductions in the warming\\ninﬂuence of BC cancelling out some of the reduced sulfatecooling.

S4\\nin the Supplement). In addition, the earlier Holocene was\\nmore volcanically active than the period after 500 BCE, fur-\\nther increasing the mean sAOD baseline. Taking the longer\\nbaseline period into account in the new pre-industrial dataset,post-1750 ERF is further increased by 0.031 W m−2.

These\\nchoices, and others, affect temperature change estimates and\\ncontribute to uncertainty (IPCC AR6 WGI Chap. 2, Cross\\nChap. Box 2.3, Gulev et al., 2021). The methods chosen here\\nclosely follow AR6 WGI and are presented in the Supple-\\nment, Sect. S5. Conﬁdence intervals are taken from AR6 as\\nonly one of the employed datasets regularly updates ensem-\\nbles (see Supplement, Sect. S5).\\nBased on the updates available as of February 2023 (which\\nwere reported in the AR6 SYR), the change in global sur-\\nface temperature from 1850–1900 to 2013–2022, using the\\nsame underlying datasets and methodology as AR6, is 1.15\\n[1.00–1.25]◦C, an increase of 0.06◦C within 2 years from\\nthe 2011–2020 value reported in AR6 WGI (Table 4).

These changes are broadly consistent with typ-\\nical warming rates over the last few decades, which were\\nassessed in AR6 as 0.76◦C over the 1980–2020 period (us-\\ning ordinary-least-square linear trends) or 0.019◦C per year\\n(Gulev et al., 2021). They are also broadly consistent with\\nprojected warming rates from 2001–2020 to 2021–2040 re-\\nported in AR6, which are in the order of 0.025◦C per year\\nunder most scenarios (Lee et al., 2021).\\nNote that the temperatures for single years include con-\\nsiderable variability and are inﬂuenced by natural forcings\\nsuch as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and sporadic vol-\\ncanic eruptions that might either cool or warm the climate for\\nshort periods (Jenkins et al., 2023). At current warming rates,individual years may exceed warming of 1.5◦C several years\\nbefore a long-term mean exceeds this level (Trewin, 2022).\\n6 Earth energy imbalance\\nThe Earth energy imbalance (EEI), assessed in Chap. 7\\nof AR6 WGI (Forster et al., 2021), provides a measure of\\naccumulated additional energy (heating) in the climate sys-\\ntem and hence plays a critical role in our understanding of\\nclimate change. It represents the difference between the ra-\\ndiative forcing acting to warm the climate and Earth’s radia-\\ntive response, which acts to oppose this warming. On annual\\nand longer timescales, the Earth heat inventory changes as-\\nsociated with EEI are dominated by the changes in global\\nocean heat content (OHC), which accounts for about 90 %\\nof global heating since the 1970s (Forster et al., 2021). This\\nplanetary heating results in changes to the Earth system such\\nas sea level rise, ocean warming, ice loss, rise in temperature\\nand water vapour in the atmosphere, and permafrost thawing\\n(e.g. Cheng et al., 2022; von Schuckmann et al., 2023a), with\\nadverse impacts for ecosystems and human systems (Dou-\\nville et al., 2021; IPCC, 2022).\\nOn decadal timescales, changes in global surface tempera-\\ntures (Sect. 5) can become decoupled from EEI by ocean heat\\nrearrangement processes (e.g. Palmer and McNeall, 2014;\\nAllison et al., 2020). Therefore, the increase in the Earth\\nheat inventory provides a more robust indicator of the rate of\\nglobal change on interannual-to-decadal timescales (Cheng\\net al., 2019; Forster et al., 2021; von Schuckmann et al.,\\n2023a). AR6 WGI found increased conﬁdence in the assess-\\nment of changes in the Earth heat inventory compared to pre-\\nvious IPCC reports due to observational advances and clo-\\nsure of the energy and global sea level budgets (Forster et al.,\\n2021; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).\\nAR6 estimated with that EEI increased from 0.50 [0.32–\\n0.69] W m−2during the period 1971–2006 to 0.79 [0.52–\\n1.06] W m−2during the period 2006–2018 (Forster et al.,\\n2021). The contributions to increases in the Earth heat in-\\nventory throughout 1971–2018 remained stable: 91 % for the\\nfull-depth ocean, 5 % for the land, 3 % for the cryosphere and\\nabout 1 % for the atmosphere (Forster et al., 2021). The in-\\ncrease in EEI (Fig. 4) has also been reported by Cheng et\\nal. (2019), von Schuckmann et al. (2020, 2023a), Loeb et\\nal. (2021), Hakuba et al. (2021), Kramer et al. (2021) and\\nRaghuraman et al. (2021). Drivers for the most recent period\\n(i.e. past 2 decades) are both the increases in effective radia-\\ntive forcing (Sect. 4) and climate feedbacks, such as cloud\\nand sea ice changes. The degree of contribution from the dif-\\nferent drivers is uncertain and still under active investigation.\\nWhile changes in EEI have been effectively monitored at\\nthe top of the atmosphere by satellites since the mid-2000s,\\nwe rely on estimates of OHC change to determine the ab-\\nsolute magnitude of EEI and its evolution on inter-annual\\nto multi-decadal time series.

(2008),\\nEN4 (Good et al., 2013), Ishii et al. (2017) and NCEI (Lev-\\nitus et al., 2012). Four of these datasets routinely provide\\nupdated OHC time series for the BAMS State of the Cli-\\nmate report, and all are used for the GCOS Earth heat in-\\nventory (von Schuckmann et al., 2020, 2023a) and the an-\\nnual WMO global state of the climate. The uncertainty as-\\nsessment for the 0–2000 m layer used the ensemble method\\ndescribed by Palmer et al. (2021) that separately accounts\\nforparametric andstructural uncertainty. The OHC change\\n>2000 m and associated uncertainty were assessed based on\\ntrend analysis of the available hydrographic data following\\nPurkey and Johnson (2010). All ﬁve of the datasets used for\\nthe 0–2000 m OHC assessment are now updated at least an-nually and should in principle support an AR6 assessment\\ntime series update within the ﬁrst few months of each year.\\nThere is potential to increase the observational ensemble\\nused in the assessment by supplementing this set with addi-\\ntional data products that are also available annually for future\\nupdates. There is also a potential to update the uncertainty es-\\ntimate after a more comprehensive understanding of the error\\nsources.\\nEstimates of EEI should also account for the other ele-\\nments of the Earth heat inventory, i.e. the atmospheric warm-\\ning, the latent heat of global ice loss and heating of the conti-\\nnental land surface (Forster et al., 2021; Cuesta-Valero et al.,\\n2021, 2023a; Steiner et al., 2020; Nitzbon et al., 2022a; Van-\\nderkelen et al., 2020; Adusumilli et al., 2022).

(2020, 2023a). However, in the absence of an-\\nnual updates to all heat inventory components, a pragmatic\\napproach is to use recent OHC change as a proxy for EEI,\\nscaling the value up as required based on historical partition-\\ning between Earth system components.\\nWe carry out an update to the AR6 estimate of changes in\\nthe Earth heat inventory based on updated observational time\\nseries for the period 1971–2020 (Table 5 and Fig. 4). Time\\nseries of heating associated with loss of ice and warming\\nof the atmosphere and continental land surface are obtained\\nfrom the recent Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)\\ninitiative (von Schuckmann et al., 2023b; Adusumilli et al.,\\n2022; Cuesta-Valero et al., 2023b; Vanderkelen and Thiery,\\n2022; Nitzbon et al., 2022b; Kirchengast et al., 2022). We\\nuse the original AR6 time series ensemble OHC time series\\nfor the period 1971–2018 and then switch to a smaller four-\\nmember ensemble for the period 2019–2022. We “splice” the\\ntwo sets of time series by adding an offset as needed to ensure\\nthat the 2018 values are identical. The AR6 heating rates and\\nuncertainties for the ocean below 2000 m are assumed to be\\nconstant through the period. The time evolution of the Earth\\nheat inventory is determined as a simple summation of time\\nseries of atmospheric heating; continental land heating; heat-\\ning of the cryosphere; and heating of the ocean over three\\ndepth layers, 0–700, 700–2000 and below 2000 m (Fig. 4a).\\nWhile von Schuckmann et al. (2023a) have also quantiﬁed\\nheating of permafrost and inland lakes and reservoirs, these\\nadditional terms are very small and are omitted here for con-\\nsistency with AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).\\nA full propagation of uncertainties across all heat inven-\\ntory components depends on the speciﬁc choice of time pe-\\nriod, and different estimates are not directly comparable.\\nTherefore, we take a simple pragmatic approach, using the\\ntotal ocean heat content uncertainty as a proxy for the total\\nuncertainty, since this term is 2 orders of magnitude larger\\nthan the other terms (Forster et al., 2021). To provide esti-\\nmates of the EEI up to the year 2022, we scale up the values\\nof OHC change in 2021 and 2022 to reﬂect the about 90 %\\ncontribution of the ocean to changes in the Earth heat inven-\\ntory. The EEI is then simply computed as the difference in\\nglobal energy inventory over each period, converted to unitsof watts per square metre (W m−2) using the surface area\\nof the Earth and the elapsed time. The uncertainties in the\\nglobal energy inventory for the end-point years are assumed\\nto be independent and added in quadrature, following the ap-\\nproach used in AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).\\nIn our updated analysis, we ﬁnd successive increases in\\nEEI for each 20-year period since 1973, with an estimated\\nvalue of 0.44 [0.05 to 0.83] W m−2during 1973–1992 that\\nalmost doubled to 0.82 [0.60 to 1.04] W m−2during 2003–\\n2022 (Fig. 4b). In addition, there is some evidence that the\\nwarming signal is propagating into the deeper ocean over\\ntime, as seen by a robust increase of deep (700–2000 m)\\nocean warming since the 1990s (Cheng et al., 2019, 2022).\\nThe model simulations qualitatively agree with the obser-\\nvational evidence (e.g. Gleckler et al., 2016; Cheng et al.,\\n2019), further suggesting that more than half of the OHC in-\\ncrease since the late 1800s occurs after the 1990s. For 1973–\\n1992, the contribution by ocean vertical layer was 66 %,\\n28 % and 1 % for 0–700, 700–2000 and >2000 m, respec-\\ntively. During 2013–2022, the corresponding layer contribu-\\ntions were 50 %, 33 % and 8 %.\\nThe update of the AR6 assessment periods to end in 2022\\nresults in systematic increases of EEI of 0.08 W m−2for\\n1975–2022 relative to 1971–2018 and 0.10 W m−2for 2010–\\n2022 relative to 2006–2018 (Table 5).\\n7 Human-induced global warming\\nHuman-induced warming, also known as anthropogenic\\nwarming, refers to the component of observed global sur-\\nface temperature increase over a speciﬁc period (for instance,\\nfrom 1850–1900 as a proxy for pre-industrial climate to the\\nlast decade) attributable to both the direct and indirect ef-\\nfects of human activities, which are typically grouped as\\nfollows: well-mixed greenhouse gases (consisting of CO 2,\\nCH4, N2O and F-gases) and other human forcings (consisting\\nof aerosol–radiation interaction, aerosol–cloud interaction,\\nblack carbon on snow, contrails, ozone, stratospheric H 2O\\nand land use) (Eyring et al., 2021). While total warming ,\\nthe actual observed temperature change potentially resulting\\nfrom both natural climate variability (internal variability of\\nthe climate system and the climate response to natural forc-\\ning) and human inﬂuences, is the quantity directly related to\\nclimate impacts and therefore relevant for adaptation, miti-\\ngation efforts focus on human-induced warming as the more\\nrelevant indicator for tracking progress against climate sta-\\nbilisation targets. Further, as the attribution analysis allows\\nhuman-induced warming to be disentangled from possible\\ncontributions from solar and volcanic forcing and internal\\nvariability (e.g. related to El Niño/La Nina events), it avoids\\nmisperception about short-term ﬂuctuations in temperature.\\nAn assessment of human-induced warming was therefore\\nprovided in two reports within the IPCC’s 6th assessment cy-\\ncle: ﬁrst in SR1.5 in 2018 (Chap. 1 Sect. 1.2.1.3 and Fig. 1.2\\nEarth Syst.

This paper provides\\nan update of the 2010–2019 period used in the AR6 to the\\n2013–2022 decade. SR1.5 deﬁned current human-induced\\nwarming as the average of a 30-year period centred on the\\ncurrent year, assuming the recent rate of warming continues\\n(see SR1.5 Chap. 1). This deﬁnition is currently almost iden-\\ntical to the present-day single-year value of human-induced\\nwarming, differing by about 0.01◦C (see results in Sect. 7.4);\\nthe attribution assessment in SR1.5 was therefore provided as\\na single-year warming. This section also updates the SR1.5\\nsingle-year approach by providing a year 2022 value.\\n7.1.2 Estimates of global surface temperature: GMST\\nand GSAT\\nAR6 WGI (Chap. 2 Cross-Chap. Box 2.3, Gulev et al., 2021)\\ndescribed how global mean surface air temperature (GSAT),\\nas is typically diagnosed from climate models, is physically\\ndistinct from the global mean surface temperature (GMST)\\nestimated from observations, which generally combine mea-\\nsurements of near-surface temperature over land and in some\\ncases over ice, with measurements of sea surface temperature\\nover the ocean. Based on conﬂicting lines of evidence from\\nclimate models, which show stronger warming of GSAT\\ncompared to GMST, and observations, which tend to show\\nthe opposite, Gulev et al. (2021) assessed with high conﬁ-\\ndence that long-term trends in the two indicators differ by\\nless than 10 % but that there is low conﬁdence in the sign of\\nthe difference in trends. Therefore, with medium conﬁdence,\\nin AR6 WGI Chap. 3 (Eyring et al., 2021), the best estimates\\nandlikely ranges for attributable warming expressed in terms\\nof GMST were assessed to be equal to those for GSAT, with\\nthe consequence that the AR6 warming attribution results\\ncan be interpreted as both GMST and GSAT. While, based\\non the WGI Chap. 2 (Gulev et al., 2021) assessment, WGI\\nChap. 3 (Eyring et al., 2021) treated estimates of attributable\\nwarming in GSAT and GMST from the literature together,\\nwithout any rescaling, we note that climate-model-based es-\\ntimates of attributable warming in GSAT are expected to\\nbe systematically higher than corresponding estimates of at-\\ntributable warming in GMST (see e.g. Cowtan et al., 2015;\\nRichardson et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; Gillett et al.,2021). Therefore, given an opportunity to update these anal-\\nyses from AR6, it is more consistent and more comparable\\nwith observations of GMST to report attributable changes in\\nGMST using all three methods (described in Sect. 7.2). The\\nSR1.5 assessment of attributable warming was given in terms\\nof GMST, which is continued here. In line with Sect. 2 and\\nAR6 WGI, we adopt GMST as the estimate of global surface\\ntemperature.\\n7.2 Methods\\nBoth SR1.5 and AR6 drew on evidence from a range of\\nliterature for their assessments of human-induced warming,\\nbefore selecting results from a smaller subset to produce a\\nquantiﬁed estimate. While both the SR1.5 and AR6 assess-\\nments used the latest Global Warming Index (GWI) results\\n(Haustein et al., 2017), AR6 also incorporated results from\\ntwo other methods, regularised optimal ﬁngerprinting (ROF)\\n(as in Gillett et al., 2021) and kriging for climate change\\n(KCC) (as in Ribes et al., 2021). In AR6, all three methods\\ngave results consistent not only with each other but also re-\\nsults from AR6 WGI Chap. 7 (see WGI Chap. 7 Supplemen-\\ntary Material (Smith et al., 2021) and Fig. 3.8 of AR6 WGI\\nChap. 3 (Eyring et al., 2021) and Supplement, Sect. S7 and\\nFig. S2), though the results from Chap. 7 were not included in\\nthe AR6 WGI ﬁnal calculation because they were not statis-\\ntically independent. Of the methods used, two (Gillett et al.,\\n2021; Ribes et al., 2021) relied on CMIP6 DAMIP (Gillett et\\nal., 2016) simulations which ended in 2020 and hence require\\nmodiﬁcations to update to the most recent years. The other\\ntwo methods (Haustein et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2021) are\\nupdatable and can also be made consistent with other aspects\\nof the AR6 assessment and methods. The three methods used\\nin the ﬁnal assessment of contributions to warming in AR6\\nare used again with revisions for this annual update and are\\npresented in the Supplement, Sect. S7, with any updates to\\ntheir approaches described in Sect. 7.2.\\n7.3 Updated estimates of human-induced warming to\\ndate\\n7.3.1 Updated estimate using the AR6 WGI\\nmethodology\\nFactoring in results from all three methods, AR6 WGI\\nChap. 3 (Erying et al., 2021) deﬁned the likely (66 %–100 %\\nprobability interval) range for each warming component as\\nthe smallest 0.1◦C precision range that enveloped the 5th to\\n95th percentile ranges of each method.

The\\nlatest results for this method were provided by Haustein et\\nal. (2017), who gave a central estimate for human-induced\\nwarming in 2017 of 1.01◦C with a 5 %–95 % range of (0.87\\nto 1.22◦C). SR1.5 then accounted for methodological uncer-\\ntainty by rounding this value to 0.1◦C precision for its ﬁnal\\nassessment of 1.0◦C and assessing the 0.8 to 1.2◦C range as\\nalikely range. No assessment of the contributions from other\\ncomponents was provided due to limitations in the GWI ap-\\nproach at the time.\\nWhile it is possible to continue the SR1.5 assessment ap-\\nproach of using a single method (GWI) rounded to 0.1◦Cprecision, for the purpose of providing annual updates this\\nis insufﬁcient; (i) 0.1◦C precision is too coarse to cap-\\nture meaningful inter-annual changes to the level of present-\\nday warming, (ii) using different selections of methods pre-\\nvents meaningful comparison between the results for decadal\\nmean and present-day warming calculations, and (iii) us-\\ning the mean of multiple methods increases the robustness\\nof the results. These points are simultaneously addressed in\\nthis update by adopting the latest multi-method assessment\\napproach, as established in WGI AR6, for both the AR6\\ndecadal mean warming update and the SR1.5 present-day\\nsingle-year warming update. Further, where SR1.5 only pro-\\nvided an assessment for human-induced warming, updates\\nin available attribution methods since SR1.5 mean that it is\\nnow also possible to provide a fully consistent assessment\\nfor all warming components. As with the attribution assess-\\nment in SR1.5, this update reports values in Table 6b for\\nsingle-year present-day attributable warming (as discussed\\nin Sect. 7.1.1), with a comparison to results calculated us-\\ning the SR1.5 trend-based deﬁnition also provided below in\\nSect. 7.4.\\n7.4 Results\\nResults are summarised in Table 6 and Fig. 5.

Results for all time periods\\nin this ﬁgure are calculated using updated datasets and methods. The 2010–2019 decade-average -assessed results repeat the AR6 2010–\\n2019 assessment, and the 2017 single-year -assessed results repeat the SR1.5 2017 assessment. For each double bar, the lighter and darker\\nshading refers to the earlier and later period, respectively. The 2013–2022 decade-average and 2022 single-year results are the updated\\nassessments for AR6 and SR1.5, respectively. Panel (a)shows updated observed global warming from Sect. 5, expressed as total GMST, due\\nto both anthropogenic and natural inﬂuences. Whiskers give the very likely range. Panels (b)and(c)show updated assessed contributions to\\nwarming, expressed as global mean surface temperature, from natural forcings and total human-induced forcings, which in turn consist of\\ncontributions from well-mixed greenhouse gases and other human forcings. Whiskers give the likely range.\\nand ﬁnally updated for the 2013–2022 period. Results from\\nSR1.5 are quoted in Table 6b for the 2017 level of human-\\ninduced warming, compared with a repeat calculation using\\nthe updated selection of methods and datasets (see Sect. 7.2)\\nand the WGI AR6 multi-method assessment approach (see\\nSect. 7.3.2), and ﬁnally updated for 2022. Method-speciﬁc\\ncontributions to the assessment results, along with time se-\\nries, are given in the Supplement, Sect. S7.\\nThe repeat calculations for attributable warming in 2010–\\n2019 exhibit good correspondence with the results in WGI\\nAR6 for the same period (see also Supplement, Sect. S7),\\nwith an exact correspondence in the best estimate and likely\\n(66 % to 100 % probability) range of human-induced warm-\\ning (Ant).\\nThe repeat calculation for the level of attributable anthro-\\npogenic warming in 2017 is about 0.1◦C larger than the\\nestimate provided in SR1.5 for the same period, resultingfrom changes in methods and observational data (see above).\\nThe updated results for warming contributions in 2022 are\\nalso higher than in 2017 due to 5 additional years of anthro-\\npogenic forcing. A repeat assessment using the SR1.5 trend-\\nbased deﬁnition (see Sect. 7.1.1) leads to results that are very\\nsimilar to the single-year results reported in Table 6b, with\\n0.02◦C differences at most (Supplement, Sect. S7).\\nThe attribution assessment in WGI AR6 concluded that,\\naveraged for the 2010–2019 period, all observed warming\\nwas human-induced, with solar and volcanic drivers and in-\\nternal climate variability estimated not to make a contribu-\\ntion. This conclusion remains the same for the 2013–2022\\nperiod. Generally, whatever methodology is used, the best\\nestimate of the human-induced warming to date is (within\\nsmall uncertainties) equal to the observed warming to date.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023 Earth Syst.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update\\n8 Remaining carbon budget\\nAR6 assessed the remaining carbon budget (RCB) in Chap. 5\\nof its WGI report (Canadell et al., 2021) for 1.5, 1.7 and 2◦C\\nthresholds (see Table 7). They were also reported in its Sum-\\nmary for Policymakers (Table SPM.2, IPCC, 2021b). These\\nare updated in this section using the same method with trans-\\nparently described updates.\\nAR5 (IPCC, 2013) assessed that global surface temper-\\nature increase is close to linearly proportional to the to-\\ntal amount of cumulative CO 2emissions (Collins et al.,\\n2013). The most recent AR6 report reafﬁrmed this assess-\\nment (Canadell et al., 2021). This near-linear relationship\\nimplies that for keeping global warming below a speciﬁed\\ntemperature level, one can estimate the total amount of CO 2\\nthat can ever be emitted. When expressed relative to a recent\\nreference period, this is referred to as the remaining carbon\\nbudget (Rogelj et al., 2018).\\nThe RCB is estimated by application of the WGI AR6\\nmethod described in Rogelj et al. (2019), which involves the\\ncombination of the assessment of ﬁve factors: (i) the most\\nrecent decade of human-induced warming, (ii) the transient\\nclimate response to cumulative emissions of CO 2(TCRE),\\n(iii) the zero emissions commitment (ZEC), (iv) the temper-\\nature contribution of non-CO 2emissions and (v) an adjust-\\nment term for Earth system feedbacks that are otherwise not\\ncaptured through the other factors. AR6 WGI reassessed all\\nﬁve terms (Canadell et al., 2021). The incorporation of factor\\n(v) was further considered by Lamboll and Rogelj (2022).\\nOf these factors, only factor (i) (human-induced warming),\\nwhere AR6 WGI used the decade-long period, 2010–2019,\\nlends itself to a regular and systematic annual update. His-\\ntorical CO 2emissions from the middle of this period until\\nthe start of the RCB are required to have an as up-to-date\\nRCB estimate as possible.\\nOther factors can be updated but depend on new evidence\\nand insights being published rather than an additional year of\\nobservational data becoming available. Factor (iv) (tempera-\\nture contribution of non-CO 2emissions) depends both on the\\navailable mitigation scenario evidence and the assessment of\\nnon-CO 2warming. Additional scenario evidence has become\\navailable through the publication of the scenario database\\nsupporting the AR6 WGIII report (Byers et al., 2022), which\\nis taken into account in this update.\\nThe RCB for 1.5, 1.7 and 2◦C warming levels is re-\\nassessed based on the most recent available data. Estimated\\nRCBs are reported below. They are expressed both relative\\nto 2020 to compare to AR6 and relative to the start of 2023\\nfor estimates based on the 2013–2022 human-induced warm-\\ning update. Note that between the start of 2020 and the end\\nof 2022, about 122 GtCO 2has been emitted (Sect. 2). Based\\non the variation in non-CO 2emissions across the scenarios\\nin AR6 WGIII scenario database, the estimated RCB val-\\nues can be higher or lower by around 200 GtCO 2depending\\non how deeply non-CO 2emissions are reduced. The impactof non-CO 2emissions on warming includes both the warm-\\ning effects of other greenhouse gases such as methane and\\nthe cooling effects of aerosols such as sulfates. The impacts\\nof these are assessed using a climate emulator (MAGICC;\\nMeinshausen et al., 2011), which was updated to capture re-\\ncent updates more accurately from the AR6 WGIII report\\nbut whose results were not captured in the AR6 WGI carbon\\nbudget estimates. This emulator update increased the esti-\\nmate of the importance of aerosols, which are expected to\\ndecline with time in low emissions pathways (Rogelj et al.,\\n2014), causing a net warming and decreasing the remaining\\ncarbon budget. The AR6 WGIII version of MAGICC is used\\nhere. If instead, the FaIR emulator were used, this would give\\nreduced non-CO 2warming and a larger carbon budget (Lam-\\nboll and Rogelj, 2022). For example, using non-CO 2warm-\\ning from the FaIR emulator to estimate the 1.5◦C remaining\\ncarbon budget results in 350 GtCO 2for a 50 % likelihood\\nwith a 17 %–83 % range of 200–700 GtCO 2. The variation\\nbetween the different estimates reﬂects the structural uncer-\\ntainty in estimating future non-CO 2warming contributions\\nand highlights inherent limits to the precision with which\\nremaining carbon budgets can be quantiﬁed. Such variation\\nin remaining carbon budget estimates illustrates that most of\\nthe total carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5◦C has al-\\nready been emitted and emphasises the robust insight that the\\n1.5◦C compatible budget is very small in light of continuing\\nhigh global CO 2emissions.\\nUpdated RCB estimates presented in Table 7 for 1.5, 1.7\\nand 2.0◦C of global warming are smaller than AR6, and geo-\\nphysical and other uncertainties therefore have become larger\\nin relative terms. This is a feature that will have to be kept in\\nmind when communicating budgets. The estimates presented\\nhere differ from those presented in the annual Global Carbon\\nBudget (GCB) publications (Friedlingstein et al., 2022a).\\nThe GCB updates have previously started from the AR6 WGI\\nestimate and subtracted the latest estimates of historical CO 2\\nemissions. The RCB estimates presented here consider the\\nsame updates in historical CO 2emissions from the GCB as\\nwell as the latest available quantiﬁcation of human-induced\\nwarming to date and a reassessment of non-CO 2warming\\ncontributions.\\nIf the single-year human-induced warming until 2022\\n(Sect. 7) were used directly in the RCB calculation, this\\nwould lead to similar remaining carbon budgets estimates to\\nthose from the decadal average approach used here; the 50 %\\nlikelihood estimates would be unchanged although other\\nlikelihoods alter somewhat because the spread due to TCRE\\nuncertainty starts 5 years later. However, we choose to only\\nshow the decadal calculation as this was assessed to be the\\nbest estimate for human-induced warming and the method\\nadopted in AR6 WGI.\\nThe RCB for limiting warming to 1.5◦C is becoming very\\nsmall. It is important, however, to correctly interpret this in-\\nformation. RCB estimates consider projected reductions in\\nnon-CO 2emissions that are aligned with a global transi-\\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Estimates are expressed relative to either the start of the year 2020 or 2023. The probability includes only the\\nuncertainty in how the Earth immediately responds to carbon, not long-term committed warming or uncertainty in other emissions.

These estimates assume me-\\ndian reductions in non-CO 2emissions between 2020–2050\\nof CH 4(50 %), N 2O (25 %) and SO 2(77 %). If these non-\\nCO2greenhouse gas emission reductions are not achieved,\\nthe RCB will be smaller (see Supplement, Sect. S8). Note\\nthat the 50 % RCB is expected to be exhausted a few years\\nbefore the 1.5◦C global warming level is reached due to the\\nway it factors future warming from non-CO 2emissions into\\nits estimate.\\n9 Examples of climate and weather extremes:\\nmaximum temperature over land\\nClimate and weather extremes are among the most visible\\nhuman-induced climate changes. Within AR6 WGI, a full\\nchapter was dedicated to the assessment of past and projected\\nchanges in extremes on continents (Seneviratne et al., 2021),\\nand the chapter on ocean, cryosphere and sea level changes\\nalso provided assessments on changes in marine heatwaves\\n(Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Global indicators related to cli-\\nmate extremes include averaged changes in climate extremes,\\nfor example, the mean increase of annual minimum and max-\\nimum temperatures on land (AR6 WGI Chap. 11, Fig. 11.2,\\nSeneviratne et al., 2021) or the area affected by certain types\\nof extremes (AR6 WGI Chap. 11, Box 11.1, Fig. 1, Senevi-ratne et al., 2021; Sippel et al., 2015). In contrast to global\\nsurface temperature, extreme indicators are less established.\\nThey are therefore expected to be subject to improvements,\\nreﬂecting advances in understanding and better data collec-\\ntion. Indeed, such efforts are planned within the World Cli-\\nmate Research Programme (WCRP) Grand Challenge on\\nWeather and Climate Extremes, which will likely inform the\\nnext iteration of this study.\\nAs part of this ﬁrst update, we provide an upgraded version\\nof the analysis in Fig. 11.2 from Seneviratne et al. (2021)\\n(Fig. 6). Like the analysis of global mean temperature, the\\nchoice of datasets is based on a compromise on the length of\\nthe data record, the data availability, near-real-time updates\\nand long-term support. As the indicator (in its current form)\\naverages over all available land grid points, the spatial cover-\\nage should be high to obtain a meaningful average, which\\nfurther limits the choice of datasets. The HadEX3 dataset\\n(Dunn et al., 2020), which is used for Fig. 11.2 in Senevi-\\nratne et al. (2021), is static and does not cover years after\\n2018. We therefore additionally include the Berkeley Earth\\nSurface Temperature dataset (building off Rohde et al., 2013)\\nand the ﬁfth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of\\nthe global climate (ERA5; Hersbach et al., 2020). Berkeley\\nEarth data currently enable an analysis of annual indices up\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023 Earth Syst. Sci.

Time series of observed temperature anomalies for land\\naverage annual maximum temperature (TXx) for ERA5 (1950–\\n2022), Berkeley Earth (1955–2021) and HadEX3 (1961–2018),\\nwith respect to 1850–1900. Note that the datasets have different\\nspatial coverage and are not coverage-matched. All anomalies are\\ncalculated relative to 1961–1990, and an offset of 0.53◦C is added\\nto obtain TXx values relative to 1850–1900. Note that while the\\nHadEX3 numbers are the same as shown in Seneviratne et al. (2021)\\nFig. 11.2, these numbers were not speciﬁcally assessed.\\nto 2021, while ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about\\n5 d (and the ﬁnal release occurs after 2–3 months).\\nOur proposed climate indicator of changes in temperature\\nextremes consists of land average annual maximum temper-\\natures (TXx) (excluding Antarctica). For HadEX3, we se-\\nlect the years 1961–2018, to exclude years with insufﬁcient\\ndata coverage, and require at least 90 % temporal complete-\\nness, thus applying the same criteria as for Fig. 11.2 (Senevi-\\nratne et al., 2021). Berkeley Earth provides daily maximum\\ntemperatures, and we require more than 99 % data availabil-\\nity for each individual year and grid, such that years with\\nmore than 4 missing days are removed. Based on this crite-\\nrion, Berkeley Earth covers at least 95 % of the global land\\narea from 1955 onwards. ERA5, on the other hand, has full\\nspatio-temporal coverage by design, and hence the entire cur-\\nrently available period of 1950 to 2022 is used. The annual\\nmaximum temperature is then computed for each grid cell,\\nand a global area-weighted average is calculated for all grid\\ncells with at least 90 % temporal completeness in the respec-\\ntive available period (1955–2021 and 1961–2018 for Berke-\\nley Earth and HadEX3, while ERA5 is again not affected by\\nthis criterion). We thus enforce high data availability to ad-\\nequately calculate global land averaged TXx across all three\\ndatasets, but their coverage is not identical, which introduces\\nminor deviations in the estimated global land averages. The\\nresulting TXx time series are then computed as anomalies\\nwith respect to a baseline period of 1961–1990.\\nTo express the TXx as anomalies with respect to 1850–\\n1900, we add an offset to all three datasets. The offset is\\nbased on the Berkeley Earth data and is derived from the lin-\\near regression of land mean TXx to the annual mean global\\nmean air temperature over the period 1955 to 2020. The off-\\nset is then calculated as the slope of the linear regressionTable 8.

We visualise this\\nwith land average annual maximum temperatures (TXx)\\nfrom three different datasets (ERA5, Berkeley Earth and\\nHadEX3), expressed as anomalies with respect to the pre-\\nindustrial baseline period of 1850–1900 (Fig. 6). From about\\n1980 onwards, all employed datasets point to a strong TXx\\nincrease, which coincides with the transition from global\\ndimming, associated with aerosol increases, to brightening,\\nassociated with decreases (Wild et al., 2005). Together with\\nstrongly increasing greenhouse gas emissions (Sect. 2), this\\nexplains why human-induced climate change has emerged at\\nan even greater pace in the last 4 decades than previously. For\\nexample, land average annual maximum temperatures have\\nwarmed by more than 0.5◦C in the past 10 years (1.72◦C\\nwith respect to pre-industrial conditions) compared to the\\nﬁrst decade of the millennium (1.22◦C; Table 8). Since the\\noffset relative to our pre-industrial baseline period is calcu-\\nlated relative to 1961–1990, within the latter period, temper-\\nature anomalies align by construction but can diverge after-\\nwards. In an extensive comparison of climate extreme in-\\ndices across several reanalyses and observational products,\\nDunn et al. (2022) point to an overall strong correspon-\\ndence between temperature extreme indices across reanaly-\\nsis and observational products, with ERA5 exhibiting espe-\\ncially high correlations to HadEX3 among all regularly up-\\ndated datasets. This suggests that both our choice of datasets\\nand approach to calculate anomalies does not affect our con-\\nclusion – the intensity of heatwaves across all land areas has\\nunequivocally increased since pre-industrial times.\\nThe anomalies with respect to 1850–1900 are derived by\\nadding an offset of 0.53◦C.

Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update\\n12 Discussion and conclusions\\nThe ﬁrst year of the Global Climate Change (IGCC) initia-\\ntive has built on the AR6 report cycle to provide a compre-\\nhensive update of the climate change indicators required to\\nestimate the human-induced warming and the remaining car-\\nbon budget. Table 9 and Fig. 7 present a summary of the\\nheadline ﬁgures from each section compared to those given\\nin the AR6 assessment. The main substantive dataset change\\nsince AR6 is that land-use CO 2emissions have been revised\\ndown by around 2 GtCO 2(Table 9). However, as CO 2ERF\\nand human-induced warming estimates depend on concen-\\ntrations, not emissions, this does not affect most of the other\\nﬁndings. Note it does slightly increase the remaining carbon\\nbudget, but this is only by 5 GtCO 2, less than the 50 GtCO 2\\nrounding precision.\\nFigure 8 summarises contributions to warming, repeating\\nFig. 2.1 of the AR6 Synthesis Report (Lee et al., 2023). It\\nhighlights changes since the assessment period in AR6 WGI.\\nTable 9 also summarises methodological updates.\\nIt is hoped that this update can support the science com-\\nmunity in its collection and provision of reliable and timely\\nglobal climate data. In future years we are particularly in-\\nterested in improving SLCF updating methods to get a more\\naccurate estimate of short-term ERF changes. The work also\\nhighlights the importance of high-quality metadata to doc-\\nument changes in methodological approaches over time. In\\nfuture years we hope to improve the robustness of the in-\\ndicators presented here but also extend the breadth of indi-\\ncators reported through coordinated research activities. For\\nexample, we could begin to make use of new satellite data\\ninversion techniques to infer recent emissions. We are partic-\\nularly interested in exploring how we might update indicators\\nof regional climate extremes and their attribution, which are\\nparticularly relevant for supporting actions on adaptation and\\nloss and damage.\\nGenerally, scientists and scientiﬁc organisations such as\\nthe WMO and IPCC have an important role as “watchdogs”\\nto critically inform evidence-based decision-making. This\\nannual update traced to IPCC methods can provide a reliable,\\ntimely source of trustworthy information. As well as helping\\ninform decisions, we can use the update to track changes in\\ndataset homogeneity between their use in one IPCC report\\nand the next. We can also provide information and testing to\\nmotivate updates in methods that future IPCC reports might\\nchoose to employ.\\nFigure 9 shows decadal trends for the attributed warming\\nand ERF. The most recent trends were unprecedented at the\\ntime of AR6 and have increased further since then (red mark-\\ners), showing that human activities are consistently causing\\nglobal warming recently of more than 0.2◦C per decade. As\\nnations and businesses forge climate policies and take mean-\\ningful action, the latest available evidence shows that global\\nactions are not yet at the scale to manifest a substantive shift\\nin the direction of global human inﬂuence on the Earth’s en-\\nFigure 9.

Indeed,\\nour results point to the opposite: the evidence shows contin-\\nued increase in cumulative CO 2emissions, increased emis-\\nsions of other GHGs and gains in air quality at the expense\\nof the loss of the cooling effect from aerosols. Both AR6\\nWGI and WGIII reports highlighted the beneﬁts of short-\\nterm reductions in methane emissions to counter the loss of\\naerosol cooling and further improve air quality – however, at\\nthe global scale, methane emissions are at their highest level\\nand rising (see Table 1). Policymakers, civil society and the\\nscientiﬁc community require monitoring data and analyses\\nfrom rigorous, robust assessments available on a regular ba-\\nsis. These results illustrate how assessments such as ours pro-\\nvide a strong “reality check” based on science and real-world\\ndata.\\nThis is a critical decade: human-induced global warming\\nrates are at their highest historical level, and 1.5◦C global\\nwarming might be expected to be reached or exceeded within\\nthe next 10 years in the absence of cooling from major vol-\\ncanic eruptions (Lee et al., 2021). Yet this is also the decade\\nthat global greenhouse gas emissions could be expected to\\npeak and begin to substantially decline. The indicators of\\nglobal climate change presented here show that the Earth’s\\nenergy imbalance has increased to around 0.9 W m−2, aver-\\naged over the last 12 years. This also has implications for the\\ncommitted response of slow components in the climate sys-\\ntem (glaciers, deep ocean, ice sheets) and committed long-\\nterm sea level rise, but this is not part of the update here.\\nHowever, rapid and stringent GHG emission decreases could\\nhalve warming rates over the next 20 years (McKenna et al.,\\n2021). Table 1 shows that global GHG emissions are at a\\nlong-term high, yet there are signs that their rate of increase\\nEarth Syst. Sci.

The Earth gives off long-wave thermal radiation, counteracting the short-wave radiation \\ncoming from the sun (stable climate). \\n• Steam as well as carbon dioxide and methane molecules in the atmosphere prevent this radiation \\nfrom being emitted back into space, trapping heat and sending a portion of it back down toward the \\nEarth’s surface. Without this natural greenhouse effect, the global average temperature would be \\nabout –18 °C instead of its actual 14 °C. This would not support life. \\n• Fossil fuel combustion has led to an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \\nAs a result, more heat is radiated back toward the Earth. The temperature on the Earth’s surface and \\nin the lower atmosphere has risen in turn. \\n• The greenhouse effect induced by humans has changed and continues to change the energy balance \\non Earth, which has led to an excess energy flow of 0.6 watts/m2. \\n• At the same time, residues in the atmosphere left behind by the combustion of fossil substances \\n(aerosols) have a cooling effect.\\nSource: Loeb et al. 2009, Trenberth et al. 2009, Wild et al. 2015.Causes of climate change\\n340\\n(340, 341)\\nincident \\nsolar radiation100\\n(96, 100)\\nreflected \\nsolar radiation\\n160\\n(154, 166)\\nabsorbed by\\nthe surface342\\n(338, 348)\\nabsorbed by \\nthe surface25\\n(22, 26)\\nreflected by \\nthe surface239\\n(236, 242)\\nthermal radiation \\nemitted back into space\\n398\\n(394, 400)\\ngiven off by \\nthe surfacegreenhouse\\ngases80\\n(74, 91)\\nabsorbed by\\nthe atmosphere\\n185\\n(179, 189)\\ndirected at\\nthe surfaceatmospheric\\nwindowClimate change upsets the Earth’s energy balance\\nin watts per square metre\\n+0.6 \\n(0.2, 1.0)\\nexcess\\nenergy\\nWhat causes climate change?

Changes in the sun’s luminosity. \\n 2. Changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun. \\n 3. Changes in the amount of climate-relevant gases (CO2, methane) and aerosols (atmospheric  \\n particulate matter, e.g. from volcanic eruptions) present in the atmosphere. \\n4. Ice cover, cloud cover and the distribution of the continents, as even these influence how much  \\nenergy is reflected back into space (Albedo effect). \\n• Most research surrounding historical climatology on Earth is based on deposits from the periods  \\nin question, for instance sediments on land and in oceans and seas as well as ice masses. Isotope \\nanalyses of the calcareous shells of microplankton offer information on temperatures in the past, \\nwhile air bubbles trapped in ice provide samples of former atmospheric compositions – including \\ngreenhouse gas concentrations.

The paper provi des a rapid re view and an alysis of the im pacts and econom ic \\ncosts fro m climate change .  The objective is to provide estimate s of the bene fits of clim ate change \\npolic y, i.e. from avoided im pacts, for support to th e Commission in considering the benefits and costs \\nof m itigation efforts, and to support  DG Environm ent in its report to the Spring Council 2005 and in \\nfuture international negotia tions on clim ate change.   \\n \\nImpacts of Climate Change (baseline) \\n \\nThe paper has reviewed the im pacts of climate cha nge, looki ng at  potential impacts at a European and  \\nglobal level.  The analy sis has identified and prior itised the major effects fro m climate chan ge.  These \\nare considere d to be: \\n• Impacts of se a level rise, e rosion, loss of land/coastal wetlands, and need for coastal protecti on; \\n• Effects on agriculture; \\n• Effects on energy  use (including  heating  and coolin g); \\n• Effects to human health from  change s in cold related and heat related effects \\n• Effects to human health from  the dise ase burden (and other secondary  effects);  \\n• Effects on water resources, water supply  and water quality ; \\n• Changes to tourism  potential and destinations; \\n• Effects on ecosy stems (loss of prod uctiv ity and b io-diversity ); \\n• Impacts fro m droug ht; \\n• Impacts fro m floodi ng; \\n• Impacts fro m storm  damage and extre me weather (in cluding costs to infrastructure); \\n• Socially  contingent effects (arising from  multiple stresses and leadi ng to m igration, fam ine, et c); \\n• Impacts fro m major events (e.g. loss of thermo-haline circulation, collapse of West-Antar ctic ice  \\nsheet, m ethane hydrates). \\n \\nMany  of the se areas are inter-relat ed.  In partic ular, the majo r events identified (the potentially \\ncatastrophic effects and major clim ate discontinuit ies) will have im pacts across all categ ories.  The  \\nrisk of avoiding these major effe cts is  highlighted as a specific  bene fit of future c limate change policy , \\nconsistent with the precautionary  principle.   \\n \\nBenefits of Different Stabilisation Targets \\n \\nThe review  has assessed the potential e ffects  of cli mate change as sociated with different st abilisation \\ntargets.  These are consistent with specific analysis of CO 2 equivalent p pm concentrations, o r \\ntemperature c hanges such as a maximum 2˚C rise above pre-in dustrial levels.  It has been difficult to \\ncomprehensi vely assess t he impacts  associated with diffe rent ta rgets, either at a Europea n or global \\nlevel.  Som e initial data highli ghts that the potent ial benefits of  stabilisation targets coul d be very \\nlarge, and there is increasin g inform ation e merging.   \\n \\nThe IPCC T hird Asses sment Report c onfirm s that risks of adve rse i mpacts from cli mate change \\nincrease  with  the magnitude of cli mate change.

The analy sis show ed rise s of 2 to 3% per y ear – so for e xample the  \\ncentral illustrative esti mate rose from  20 – 25/tCO 2 from emission s in the  year 2000  to 34 Euro/tCO 2 \\nby 2020 (i n 2000 prices).  \\n \\nThe values from  such studies are dependant on a num ber of ke y assum ptions, not ably the discount rate \\nused and the aggregation approach for im pacts in diffe rent regions (whether distributional weights, i.e. \\nequit y weights7) are used.  The choice o f discount rate has a very  large eff ect o n any values, because \\nmost impacts of cli mate change occur in the future.  Si milarly  most impacts occur in de veloping \\ncountries, and so the deci sion on  whether to equit y weight or n ot has a signi ficantly  bearing o n the \\nresults8.  \\n \\nEconomic Benefits of different stabilisation targets \\n \\nEmerging work is starting to assess the potential benef its of different stabilisation targets.  One recent  \\nstudy9 has un dertaken an expert consult ation o n the soci al costs of specific cli mate change sc enarios .  \\nThe scenario s included three te mperatu re scenarios ( <2˚C, 2-4 ˚C, >4 ˚C), but also included variables \\nwith respect to major events, socially  contingent e ffects, discount rates, equity  weightin g, etc. Most \\nexperts believed that und er conditions  of low temperature change (2 ˚C), the marginal s ocial costs  \\nwould be low, most probably  below Euro 15/tCO 2.  In contrast, for high te mperature chan ge (>4 °),  \\nthe expert response was that costs would be hi gh: probabl y greater than Eur o 30/tCO 2 and plausibly as \\nhigh as 14 0Euro/tCO 2.   \\n \\nThe current s tudy has also commissioned two new  pieces  of work from the F UND and PAG E models , \\nto investigate the potential benefits of diffe rent stabilisation targets.  The PAGE2002 m odel10 has been \\nused to exam ine a num ber of different stabili sation targets. The results show costs  of \\n• Euro 74 trilli on from  climate change under the b aseline business as usual scen ario for an average  \\ndiscount rate of 2%  pure rate of time pr eference and including  equi ty weighting11, falling to \\n• Euro 43 trilli on under a 650 CO 2 equiva lent ppm  stabilisation scenario, and  \\n• Euro 32 trilli on under a 550 CO 2 equiva lent ppm  stabilisation scenario.   \\n \\nThe analy sis has also used the FUND model to assess the potential social costs under different CO2  \\nstabilisation levels.  This a nalysis above  shows a stro ng decline in the m arginal  social cost of current  \\nemissions with lower CO 2 stabilisation concentrations.  \\n                                                      \\n7 By using equity  weighting, it is p ossible to take int o account how t he costs and benefits  accrue to different groups i n society .  Policies that  \\ndeliver  greater  net benefit to indivi duals in lower inco me groups  are rated more favour ably than those that benef it higher .  Equity weights can \\ntherefore be used t o explicitly  recognise distributional effects within a policy ’s net present va lue.  In  the case  of cli mate change,  we ar e trying \\nto recognise that  vulnerable societies ar e likely  to see si gnifi cant im pacts , and ther efore that  climate change mitigation p olicy will have a dis-\\nproportionately  larger  benefit to these gr oups. \\n8 Most models show that at s mall to moderate cli mate change,  poor er countr ies (Africa, India, and L atin Am erica) are net econ omic losers, \\nwhereas r icher cou ntries, especiall y mid – Northern l atitudes may actuall y gain.  Essentiall y, the  more weigh t we put on the di stribution o f \\nthe impacts of  climate change in  developing countries, the more severe  the aggregate i mpacts are.   \\n9 Tom Downing at t he Stockhol m Environ ment Institute (Oxf ord o ffice), as part of r ecent work  for Defra (UK).  \\n10 Run by  Chris Hope at the Judge I nstitute at the Univer sity of Cam bridge. \\n11 Values are in 2000 prices.

Ther e is an e merging view that planning for cli mate \\nchange adaptation shoul d begin as soon as possibl e because antici patory and precautionary  adaptation \\nis more effective and less costly  than forced, l ast minute, emergency  adaptation or retrofitting (EEA \\n2004).   The abilit y of human sy stems to adapt  to and cope wit h clim ate change depends  on such \\nfactors as wealth, technology , education, inform ation, skills, infrastructure, access to resources and \\nmanagement capabilities (TAR 2001).  Developing count ries have less of these attributes and as a \\nresult have a lesser capacit y to adapt and are more vul nerable to climate chang e impacts.  R eviews of  \\nclimate change adaptation work12 have shown that climate chang e costing studies often pay  little \\nattention to adaptation costs and further research  would increase the reliability  of adaptation cost \\nestimates. \\n \\nAncillary effects  \\n \\nThere is gro wing recognition that m itigation poli cies or scenarios that ar e aimed at  reducing \\ngreenhouse gas em issions may have important an cillary benefits.  These potentially  include: \\n• Reductions in  air polluti on; \\n• Reductions in  other enviro nmental burd ens; \\n• Increased securit y of energ y suppl y (and /or energ y diversity ), including red uced oil im ports; \\n• Improved com petitiveness; \\n• Increas ed employment; \\n• Innovatio n. \\n \\nWhilst the full benefit of greenhou se gas reductions resulting from  further clim ate action may only be \\nexperienced by future generations, the ancillary  bene fits of climate policy  will accrue to th e current \\ngeneration.  However, there have also been concer ns that policies may lead to potential dis -benefits, \\nwith some literature referri ng to: \\n• Impacts on trade and com petitiveness (note this is  also m entioned as a potential benefit above); \\n• Decreases in em ployment (again, this is also mentioned as a potenti al benefits above); \\n• Lifesty le changes; \\n• Security  and proliferation with specific technolog y options (n uclear). \\n \\nThe study  has reviewed the available information on a ncillary  effects.  From  this,  we conclude that the \\nair qualit y benefits of GHG mitigation are likely to amount to a substantial benefit.  A recent stud y \\n(Defra, 2002)  found 20 est imates of the monetary  value of ancilla ry benefits in the literatur e.  The \\nestimates ran ge from  1 Euro to 130 Euro/tCO 2 reduc ed, with an a verage fro m across the stu dies of 27 \\nEuro/tCO 2.   \\n \\nIt is also likely  that many  low carbon technol ogies will have ancillary  benefits fro m reducing \\ndependence on im ports and increasi ng energy  security .  This is due  to the likely  increas e in \\nrenewables, nuclear generation, coal gen eration w ith sequestration, as well as improvem ents in energy  \\nefficiency .  The effects of policies on e mployment, trade and com petitiveness rem ain the subject of \\nmuch debate.  These issues will be exam ined later in the study  through the use of the GEM-E3 m odel.   \\n \\nAncillary  effects are im portant, and s hould be factor ed into t he analy sis of future climate change \\npolicies.  However, to assess these i mpacts properly,  the ancilla ry effects need to be assessed and  \\nreported separately , as the y will vary with th e exact policies and measures i mplemented.  \\n                                                      \\n12 Clim ate Change Im pacts  and Adapta tion: A Can adian Perspective, Natura l Resour ces Can ada 200 4 \\nhttp://adaptation.nr can.gc.ca/ perspecti ve/profile_e.asp  \\nAEA Technol ogy Environment, August 2005 v', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\final_report2_en.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='The Impacts and Costs of Climate Change \\n \\nConclusions  \\n \\nThe review has shown that the im pacts of climate change and th eir econom ic costs are sig nificant.   \\nInitial assessment of the benefits of st abilisation ta rgets shows that many of the major effects o f \\nclimate change could be a voided, an d the benefits of post-Kyoto policies could be ver y significant in \\nterms of reductions in im pacts and soci al costs.  Ther e is also the major benefit of reducing the risk of \\nmajor catastrophic events.  \\n \\nThe review here has shown that the inform ation on im pacts and econom ic costs is increasing. \\nHowever, th ere rem ain major information gaps a nd further rese arch is  needed to i mprove th e \\ninform ation available to fully  assess t he benefits o f policies.  From the info rmation avail able, we  \\nbelieve that m onetary  valuation of cli mate change policies is po ssible, and should be taken forward.   \\nHowever, w e also believe that care m ust be taken in presenting and inte rpreting the monetary \\nestimates, for  example by  avoiding the use of singl e simplistic estimates:  given the uncertainty  over \\nfuture scenar ios and im pacts, monetary valuation, and ethical and m oral issu es, there is no ‘single ’ \\nestimate of the social costs of climate change.  Further to this, we make a number of additional  \\nrecommendat ions that would im prove the analy sis presented here. \\n• Firstly , we reco mmend that work is undertaken to  present a more disaggregated analy sis of the \\nphysical im pacts of cli mate change, a nd the benefits of future polic y.   \\n• Secondl y, we reco mmen d that more disaggregat ed information is presented on the econom ic \\nvaluation of clim ate chan ge, showing the ba lance of positive and negative econom ic effects \\n(winners and losers) by i mpact category and regi on, rather tha n using single aggregated global \\nvalues.   \\n• Finall y, we reco mmend that the an alysis of fu ture policies should consider full sensitivity and \\nuncertainty  analysis, along with the i nform ation o f key  impacts, to allow t he co mparison of \\nbenefits against the possibl e costs of future mitigation policies.   \\n \\nTo progress these are as, w e reco mmend  a num ber of specific re search conclusions: \\n \\nFirst, some further work with the integrated asse ssment models: \\n• Additional m odel runs  with PAGE and FUND would be useful to test different future policies  \\n(towards sta bilisation targets for CO 2 equivalents of 400 p pm, 450 ppm , etc), with different \\nassumptions relating to baselines, discount rates, e quity weighti ng, and unce rtainty  anal ysis in \\nrelation to cl imate sensitivit y.

very large.   \\n \\nThe IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001)  outlines the pot ential effects of clim ate change. It  \\npresents an  increasing body  of observations that give  the picture of a  warming world and changes in  \\nglobal and re gional clim ate systems.  Taking 1990 as the basel ine, the current m odels p roject the \\nfollowing key clim ate change im pacts by 210 0. \\n• Global average tem perature is predicted to rise b y 1.4 to 5.8 °C over the period to 2100  \\n(temperatures rose b y +0.6 °C in the 20t h Centur y); \\n• Globally precipitation increase s, but with regional increases and decreas es of typically  5 to 20% in \\nannual average rainfall; \\n• Sea levels rise by 0.0 9 to 0.88 m ; \\n• Extrem e even ts such as drought an d severe storm s are more likely ; \\n• Beyond 2100 major changes in the climate sy stem (e.g. alteration of Nort h Atlantic Circulation, \\ncollapse of West Antarctic Ice Sheet) be come more likely if clim ate change is not stabilised. \\n \\nThese changes will lead to m ajor i mpacts on biod iversity and ecosy stem  services, on econom ic \\nactivities and on human health and welfare (includi ng the loss of life and forced migration) with \\nassociat ed implications for international equity .   \\n \\nTraditionall y the polic y debate on cli mate change h as focused on the costs of m itigation, i.e. how \\nmuch it will cost to reduce greenhouse gas em issions in order t o avoid clim ate change.  This paper  \\nfocuses on th e impacts and econo mic costs to society  from cli mate change actual ly occurring13.  These  \\ncosts repre sent the benefits of cli mate change policy  and can be co mpared against the costs of \\ngreenhouse gas em ission mitigation. \\n \\nPolicy Background \\nThe EU is committed to providing leadership in t he field of clim ate change and, as such, a key priorit y \\nis contributing to global climate stabilisation effort s bey ond 2 012. As part of this priorit y, the EU \\nneeds to identify  an em ission reduction target up to 2030 and in dicative targets bey ond14.  Different  \\nemission reduction strategies and/or di fferent post-Kyoto targets will need  to be evaluated in order to \\nprepare for: \\n• The Commission Report t o the Sprin g Council 20 05; \\n• Negotiations on fut ure commit ments at  international level. \\n \\nIn order to balance the climate policy  debate, the Commission requires the benefits of climate change \\nmitigation policies to be evaluated.  Quantified benefits will ensure a more even judgem ent of polic y \\nimpacts agai nst the widely reported costs of im plementing the policies.  Mo netised avoid ed im pact \\nbenefits, esti mated globally, but with a  focus also on the Europe an scale, will enable fully  inform ed \\n                                                      \\n13 The econom ic costs to society of cl imate chan ge ar e also known as  the social cost of climate change  (and  sometime the  \\nsocial cost of carbon (the SCC)).  \\n14 ‘Council believes that globa l average te mperatures should not exceed  2 degrees above pre-ind ustrial level and  therefore  \\nconcen trations lower than 550pp m CO 2 should guide globa l limi tation and redu ction effort ’.

Coastal  \\nprotection is possible, though this leads to additiona l costs.  Risin g sea level s increases the l ikelihood \\nof storm  surges, enforces landward in trusion of  salt water and endangers coastal ecosy stems and \\nwetlands.  Estimates in the European Union, where the coastline is about 89,000 km long,  indicate \\nsome 68 million people could be affected by  sea level changes (EC 1997).   \\n \\nAt a global level, the effect is potentiall y more extr eme.  Populatio ns that i nhabi t small islands and/or \\nlow-ly ing coastal areas (e.g. small isla nd states su ch as the Mal dives, the Ba ngladesh delta) are  at \\nparticular risk of severe social and econom ic eff ects fro m sea-l evel rise and st orm surges.  The loss o f \\nthese ar eas ( e.g. for those living on small island states) will have potentiall y important secondary \\neffects through m igration and p otential socially  contingent effects.   \\n \\nEnergy \\nHigher avera ge temperatur es ar e predict ed in Europe, with both war mer summe rs and winter s.  There \\nis also likely  to be chang es in  seasonal tem perature variability , with increased su mmer peaks (heat  \\nwaves) (EEA 2004).  The changes in average and p eak tem peratur es will hav e positive an d negative  \\neffects on energy use.  There is likely to be a decr ease in winter energy  dem and for heating, but this \\nwill be offset by an incre ase in summer energy us e for cooling (air conditi oning).  The pattern of \\nchanges in e nergy use wi ll vary  across Europe, with northern l atitudes likely  to experie nce more \\nbenefits.  Changes in energy use w ill also occur at a global level.  \\n \\nHealth: ther mal stre ss  \\nMore than 20 000 excess deaths attributable to heat , particularly  among the aged population, occurred \\nin western and southern  Europe duri ng the summer of  2003. Heat waves ar e projected to become more \\nfrequent and more intense during the twenty -first century  and hence the num ber of excess de aths due \\nto heat is projected to increase in the future17. However, rising tem peratures will reduce winter  excess \\ndeaths (and at present th e cold leads to far more deaths than t he heat). Thi s will have particular \\nbenefits in northern latitudes of Europe.  B y 2080 in Europe, it i s likel y that cold winters will have  \\nalmost entirely disappeared (EEA 2004).    \\n \\nHealth: disease burden \\nIn Europe tick-borne encephalitis cases increased in the Baltic region and central Europe between  \\n1980 and 1995, and have rem ained high (EEA 2004). Ticks can transm it a variet y of diseases,  such as  \\ntick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and L yme disease (i n Eu rope called L yme borreliosis). It is not clear \\nhow m any of the 85 000 cases of Lyme borreliosis reported annuall y in Europe are due to the  \\ntemperature i ncreas e over the past decades. \\n \\nRecent work  on clim ate change and human health risk and responses (McMi chael et al, 2003) ha s \\nlooked at dise ase risk at a g lobal level. T hey estim ate: \\n• In 2030 the estimated risk of diarrhoea will b e up to 10% higher in so me regions than if no \\nclimate change occurred. \\n• Estim ated effects on malnutrition will vary m arkedly am ong regions.  B y 2030, the relative  risks \\nfor unm itigat ed em issions, relative to no cli mate change, vary  from a significant increase in  the \\nSouth- East Asia r egion t o a sm all decrease in th e Western Pacific. Overall, although the esti mates \\nof changes in risk are  somewhat unstab le becaus e of regional variation in rainfall, they  refer to a \\nmajor existing disease burden entailing large num bers of people.  \\n                                                      \\n16 IPCC Third  Assessment Report ( 2001).  \\n17 Impacts of Euro pe’s chang ing climate An  indicato r-based assessment EEA  Repo rt No 2/2004  \\nAEA Technol ogy Environment, August 2005 8', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\final_report2_en.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='The Impacts and Costs of Climate Change \\n \\n• The estimated proporti onal changes in the num bers of people killed or injured in coastal floods  \\nare large, althoug h the y refer to low absolute bur dens.

The cultivated area could be  \\nexpanded northwards, and growing seasons extended (EEA 2004).  This will le ad to increased crop  \\nyields ( provided there is sufficient water suppl y).  In southern  parts of Euro pe, over the l onger term , \\nagriculture may be threate ned by  clim ate change due  to increased water str ess, with reduced y ields in \\nhotter and dr yer areas.  During the heat wave in 2003, m any southern European countries suffered \\ndrops in yield of up to  30% , while so me northern European countries profited fro m higher \\ntemperature s and lower rainfall. Bad harvests coul d beco me more common due to an increase in the  \\nfrequency  of extrem e weather events (droughts, floods, storms, hail).  There is also the possibilit y that \\nany direct yield gain could be partly off-set by losses due to cha nges in the s patial distribution and \\nintensity  of pests and disea ses. \\n \\nGlobal projections18 estimate EU (and US ) yield increa ses for up to 2°C te mperature rise, but beyond \\nthis y ield declines.

This is only  the case  for rapidly adapting \\necosy stems such as deserts  and grasslands but is not true of forest ecosy stems. \\n \\nThe study  also reports that the adaptive capacity  of forests rapidly  declines at increasing global mean \\ntemperature increases. In ecosy stem s, many  species , such as trees, have long lifetim es and lim ited \\ndispersal cap acities.  For exa mple, the maxi mum dispersal rat e of common tree speci es is  less than \\n100km  per centur y.  \\n \\nAt a rate of warm ing of 0 .1OC per decade (i.e. 1OC GMTI in 2100), 50%  of all im pacted ecosy stems \\nare able to adapt within a cen tury but o nly 36% of all im pacted for ests. Even when no \\nadditional increase in te mperature is  assumed, this percentage  of ecosy stems able to adapt i ncreas es \\nonly slowl y when simulations continue beyond 2 100. The adapt ed areas enco mpass imme diate shifts \\nalong current  ecosy stem  boundaries and ecosy stem s that  can easily adapt, suc h as grasslan ds. Further \\nspread of adapted ecosy stems continues at an ex tremely slow pace (up to 100km  per century ).  \\n \\nEven sm all climate chang es will have substantia l consequences on tem peratur e-limited eco systems, \\nsuch as tundra and it is suggested that the large- scale impacts will occur.  All other ecosy stems \\nwill, however, also be influenced but there are large regional differences depending on the original \\nspecies, ecosy stem and landscape, their sensitivit y and exposure  to regional changes in te mperature \\nand precipitation patterns. Not all i mpacts are negativ e. For exam ple, tundra that is replaced b y forests \\ncould potenti ally store more carbon and provide a dditional ecosy stem  services (e.g. wood). However, \\nthe decline of stressed sp ecies and ecosystems is generally  a fa st process (years to decades), often  \\ntriggered by  disturbances, while adaptation through migration and regrowth is a slow proces s (decade s \\nto centuries to m illennia). \\n \\nForest ecosy stems require the longest response ti mes and have a  low adaptive capa city, while most \\nother ecosy stems respond m ore rapidly. Large cha nges are projected in the boreal and t emperate \\nforests but they  will pr obably not be realised during this century. There will be severe ti me lags in  \\nthe response, which will lead to a sub-optim al functioning of these ecosy stem s and increase their  \\nsensitivity  to pests and other disturbances, which ar e sources of additional stress. This highlights the \\nvulnerabilit y of ecosy stems with increasing tem peratures.   The key conclusi on from  Leemans and \\nEickhout ’s paper is that even with a small global mean temperature increase,  ecosy stem  impacts will \\nbe prono unced.  \\n \\nMore recent research into ecosy stem i mpacts indi cates that  impacts and vulnerability  of ecosy stems \\nare likely  to be underestimated.  Leemans presente d findin gs at the International S ymposium  on the \\nStabilisation of Greenhouse Gases, F ebruar y 2005, concluding that ecosy stems respond faster to \\nchanges in extre me weather than to  average cli mate change.  This helps to explain the m ore rapid \\nappearance of ecological r esponses around the worl d, as a result  of an increase in extreme weather  \\nevents.  In order to m inimise ecosy stem  destruction,  Leemans proposed that efforts be m ade to lim it \\nglobal warm ing to maximally 1. 5oC above pre-indust rial levels and lim it the rate of change to less than \\n0.05oC per de cade (Leemans 200 5). \\n \\nWater resources, water supply and w ater quality  \\nThere ar e likely  to be significant changes in future E uropean precip itation (rainfall), both in term s of \\naverage pre cipitation, seas onal variations, and the l evels of he avy events.  The  projections for Europe  \\nshow increases in precipitation, but the re will be seasonal variations, and st rong regional differences \\nbetween northern and southern countries.  Northern Europe is likely  to see increases in r ainfall, and \\nincreases in annual river discharges.  Southern Euro pe is likely  to see decreases in rainfall and river  \\ndischarges, which m ay lead to f urther st ress on water resources (E EA 2004).  T his may  have important  \\nimpacts on agriculture as moisture availab ility is already  often lim ited in summer. \\n \\nWater resources are s ensitive to clim atic variations in almost all regions of the world.

The shape of the temperature response  \\ncurves in the 2050s is qui te different from  that in  the 2080s. Risk rises rapidly with any  temperature \\nincrease in th e 2050s, whilst in the 2080s, risk initiall y rises quite slowly. A 1OC increase in the 2050s  \\nis associated  with an i mpact al most ten  times larger than in the 2080s, whereas the level of risk is \\ncomparable i n both periods for a 2OC or higher war ming.

For the 20 20s, m ost of the current globa l \\nclimate models im ply a level of risk of  additional number of peo ple in water shortage regions i n \\nthe range 400-800 m illion f or around a 1OC warming.  \\n• 1.5OC of wa rming produces quite different but neve rtheless s ubstantial levels of risk in the  \\ndifferent tim e periods under the Parry  et al. (2001) analy sis, with a peak in the 2050s at over 1,50 0 \\nmillion, declining t o aroun d 500 m illion in the 2080s.  \\n• A major thre shold change in risk occur s in the P arry et al. (2001) analy sis in moving fro m 1.5OC \\nto 2-2.5OC, with the num bers rising fro m close to 600 m illion to between  2.4-3.1 billi on. As \\nexplained earlier, this is driven by  the water de mand of m egacities in Indian and China in their \\nmodel. \\n•  2OC war ming and above produces consistently  very high levels of additiona l risk at all time \\nperiods unde r the HadCM 2 scenarios. The range of risk for the current array  of m odels i n the \\n2050s is in the range 662 million to around 3 billi on. \\n• Above 2.5OC warm ing the level of risk begins to saturat e in the ra nge of 3.1- 3.5 billi on addi tional  \\npersons at risk. \\n \\nAbove 2 to 2.5°C global  average temperature incr ease it is projected that an additional 2.4 to 3.1 \\nbillion people  will be at risk of water stress23. \\n \\nDrought \\nOne of the most serious effects of cli mate change will be to increase the risk an d possibl y the duration \\nof drou ghts.   \\n \\nDrought will have negative im pacts in southern Europe where projections indicate up to 1 % per  \\ndecade decrease in annual precipita tion with decreases of 5 % per decade possible in summer (EEA \\n2004).  This r eduction i n precipitation i n southern  Europe is expe cted to have s evere effects, includi ng \\nmore frequen t droughts, wi th considerable i mpacts on agriculture and water resources.  These negative \\neffects can cause very  heavy  econom ic losses, fo r exam ple droughts in 1999 caused losses of more \\nthan Euro 3 billion i n Spai n (EEA, 2004). \\n \\nAt a global level, higher temperature s and erratic  rainfall are t he primary  causes, while a shift in \\ncirculation patterns, such as extended periods of El Niños, could see droughts lasting for y ears and \\npossibl y decades.  Although the scenari os of future dr ought risk ar e as y et uncertain, the effects would \\nbe serious.  The immediate consequences—water st ress, food scarcity , reduced plant gr owth, disease \\nburdens—can lead to econom ic, social and even pol itical stresses.  The most severe consequences,  \\nsuch as fa mine, forced migration and dis ease epide mics need not be direct conse quences of a drought; \\nhowever an increase in drought risk wi th clim ate change could push some sensitive ecosy stem s and  \\neconom ies beyond a threshold of sustainabilit y.  The global econom ic cost of drought has not been  \\ncalculated.  However, droughts i n Afri ca have cost up to  8% of GDP, primarily due  to loss of p ower \\nproductio n from hydroelectric plants.24  Annual average losses in the United States due to drought  are \\nestimated at $6 to $8 billion.25   \\n                                                      \\n23 Source: Parr y et al, 2001  \\n24 Benson, C. and  Edward J.

Econom ic losses resulting from weather \\nand clim ate related events have increased significantly  in the last 20 y ears, from an annual av erage of \\nless than US D 5 billion t o about USD 11 billion. T his is due to wealth increase and more frequent \\nevents. Four out of the fiv e years with the largest  econom ic losses in this period have occu rred since \\n1997 .

These would be classified as ‘significant’  changes in cli mate, and from  a \\nprecautionary principle viewpoint, these would be the effects th at we would want to avoid.  The y \\npotentiall y include (Schellnhuber, 2004,  Downing et al, 2004, Stabilisation 2005).): \\n• Loss of the West Antarcti c ice sheet; \\n• Loss of the Greenland ice s heet; \\n• Methane outb ursts, includi ng runawa y methane hy drates; \\n• Instabilit y or collapse of the Amazon Forest; \\n• Reduced carb on sink capacity; \\n• Changes in the ther mo-haline circulation (loss or reversal of the gulf strea m, changes in Atlantic \\ndeep water fo rmation, changes in southern o cean upwelling/circum polar deep water for mation); \\n• Indian Mons oon transfor mation; \\n• Change in stabilit y of Saharan vegetation; \\n• Tibetan albedo change; \\n• ENSO triggering; \\n• Clim ate change induced oz one hole; \\n• Salinit y valve s; \\n• Rearrangement of bi ome distributions; \\n• A shift in m ean cli mate to wards an El Nino like state; \\n• Bodele dust suppl y change; \\n \\nMany (but  importantly  not all) are thoug ht to  be longer-term  events (i.e. that woul d occur at  \\ntemperature changes >2˚C).  The risk of these effects might warrant the consideration of a strong \\nprecautionary approach in polic y setting, based ar ound strong sust ainabilit y principles.  This would \\nsupport the setting of a precautionary  threshold (e.g. such as the 2 ˚C level or another level that the \\nscientific evi dence indicated). \\n \\nRecent re search indicates that in m any cases the risk s from  climate change i mpacts ar e great er than  \\noriginall y thought at t he time of the Thi rd Asse ssment Report 2001.  The Interna tional Sy mposiu m on \\nthe Stabilisation of Greenhouse Gases, held in Febru ary 2005, identified new im pacts.  For exam ple, \\nthe recent change in the a cidity of the ocean is likel y to reduce the capacity  to re move C O2 from  the \\natmosphere and affect the entire marine food chain (S tabilisation 2005). \\n \\nIt has been highlighted that cat astrop hic effects fr om major ch anges in the cli mate system could \\noverwhelm  our response strategies.   \\n \\nCritical te mperature thres holds were proposed at the International S ymposium  which would tri gger \\nmajor catastrophic effects.

It is m uch more difficult to \\nfind the i mpacts at  differe nt concentration or te mperature levels,  especially  at a global sc ale, and to  \\ncombined thi s to provi de a matrix of the benefits of di fferent policy out-tur ns.   \\n \\nThe Third Asses sment Report confirm s that risks of adverse im pacts fro m climate change increase  \\nwith the m agnitude of cli mate change .

The m ost co mmo n metric is monetary.  A monetary  metric is parti cularly  well \\nsuited to m easure market i mpacts.  For exa mple: the costs of sea level rise could be expressed as the  \\ncapital cost of protection  and the econom ic value of land and  structures lost in the a bsence of \\nprotection; agricultural i mpact can be ex pressed as costs or benefit s to producers and consu mers; and  \\nchanges in water runoff might be expre ssed in ne w flood damage estimates.. Using a m onetary metric \\nto express non-m arket i mpacts, such  as effects o n ecosy stem s or hum an health, is m ore difficult, \\nthough it is  possible.  There is a broad and est ablished literature on valu ation theory  and its \\napplication, i ncluding studies on the monetary valu e of lower m ortality  risk, e cosystems, qualit y of \\nlife, etc. However, economic valuation, especially  in the area of climate chan ge, is often particularly  \\ncontroversial, because of e cosystem and socially  contingent effects , the potentia l magnitude of major \\nimpacts (incl ude irreversible cli mate shifts), and because of issues with i ntergenerational and \\ninternational equit y.  There is also an in complete understanding of cli mate chan ge itself.  Nonetheless,  \\nthere has been considerable rese arch in to this area, and num erous studies have esti mated the costs of \\nclimate chan ge. We have summarised t he key  areas that these stu dies focus on, along with co mments \\non valuatio n, in the bo x bel ow.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Social Costs of Climate Change: Key Ar eas of  Asse ssment in the Litera ture and the Models \\n \\nSea level rise  leads t o costs of additional protection, or otherwise loss of dry land and wetland loss.  The bal ance \\nwill d epend upon future d ecisio ns abou t wh at protectio n is justified.  Co sts of p rotection are relativ ely well  \\nknown and included in nearly all models, but  other costs (rising sea l evels increases the likelihood of st orm \\nsurges, e nforces landwa rd intrusion of sal t water and e ndangers c oastal ecosy stems and wetlands) are more \\nunce rtain and often excl uded (or only partially capt ured in terms of valuation).    Pop ulations that inh abit sm all \\nislands a nd/or low-lying coa stal areas are at  particular risk of se vere s ocial and ec onomic effect s from sea-l evel \\nrise and st orm surges.  T his raises the issue of m igration (e.g. for th ose liv ing on small island states), the co sts of  \\nwhich depend on  diverse social an d po litical factors (so called  socially co ntingent effects) bu t these are no t \\ncaptured in  the curren t valuation models.   \\n \\nEnerg y use impacts will d epend on average temperatu res an d range, but there will b e a co mbination of in creases \\nand decrea ses in dem and for heat ing (both in terms of o verall energy supplied, and to meet peak dem ands).   \\nBenefits from  increase d winte r temperatures  that re duce  heating need s may be offset by increases i n demand for \\nsummer air conditioning, as average summer te mperatu res in crease.  The models cap ture th ese effects, alth ough \\nthe re ference scenari o is difficult to project. \\n \\nAgricultura l impa cts depend upon regional changes in temperature and r ainfall, as w ell as at mospheric car bon \\ndioxide lev els (and fertilisati on).  Th e key impacts will  be to crop s and changes in the cultivated area and yield s.  \\nThese effects dep end on many factors and  in some areas, the area su itable for cultivation  and potential yield s will \\nincrease.  Climate v ariability, as well as m ean climate ch ange, is an  important consideratio n.  Ad aptive respo nses \\nwill b e important - cho ice of crop , development of new cu ltivars and  other tech nical ch anges, esp ecially \\nirrigation (see also water supp ly below).

Clim atic variability is \\ntherefore im portant in determin ing damages.  Cli mate change will ex acerb ate water sho rtages in many water-\\nscarce areas of the worl d. There is the potent ial for water scarcity and seve re socially  cont ingent dam ages, whi ch \\nare not quantified at prese nt.  Water supply is included in some models, though coverage is often partial.  \\n \\nHealth impa cts include both an increa se in (sum mer) heat stress an d a re ductio n in (winter) c old stre ss, though \\nas th ese are i n opposite directio ns the net mortality i mpact (g lobal) of direct te mperatu re changes m ay be quite \\nsmall.  Direct health im pacts from  temperature c hange s are included and valued in many studies.  The area \\namenable to parasitic an d vector borne diseases, su ch as malaria, will e xpand and impacts co uld be large.  Th e \\ninclusion of disease b urdens has been advanced  through specific studies, and some models include pa rtial \\ncove rage of such ef fects.  S ocially cont ingent dam ages t o heal th (via other i mpacts such as f ood production, \\nwater resou rces an d sea lev el rise) in  vulnerab le co mmunities are di fficult to estimate but could be very large, \\nand t hese are not include d in any of the valuation m odelling framewor ks.  Ove rall, climate chan ge is project ed to \\nincrease t hreats to  human health , particularly in  lower in come populations, predominantly with in \\ntropical/subtropical count ries.  \\n \\nEcosyst ems a nd biodiversi ty impacts are a mongst the most co mplex a nd difficult to eval uate.  Ecological \\nproductivity an d biodiversity will b e altered  by clim ate change and sea-lev el rise, with an increased  risk  of \\nextinction of s ome vulnerable speci es. M ost of the major ecosystem typ es are likely to be affected, at least in \\nparts of their range.  Som e isolated sy stems are part icularly at risk, including unique an d val uable systems (e.g.  \\ncoral reefs ).  Recent evi dence has als o identified aci dification of the  ocea ns, which is a n observa ble conse quence \\nof ri sing CO2 levels in  the atmosphere, with potentially  larg e im pacts on marine ecosystem s and flux es of \\ngreenhouse gases bet ween the ocea n and the atm osphere.  The a nalysis of ec osystems effect s is one of the most \\nproblematic areas, in  term s of a co mprehensive or relia ble assessm ent of t he im pacts of clim ate change  on \\necosy stems, and on valuations of ecosystems.  M ost studies do not ca pture ecosy stems effects fu lly –  with \\nvaluation s relyin g on ad hoc estimates of species lo ss and  contentious valuation stud ies.  The value of ecosystem \\nfunction may also be important, but has rece ived even less attention, and is not included in valuation modelling.   \\n \\nExtreme weat her events  are also likely to increase , with heat  waves, drought, floods, and potentially storms, \\ntropical cyclones and even super-typ hoons.  However, the frequency and sev erity of  extreme events may not be \\nlinearly d ependent on average cli mate.  C limate v ariability will a lso be important and there is n o consensus on \\nhow t his will change. Im pacts and damages will also depend on t he location a nd timing of the hazard and \\nadaptive responses.  Fo r example, cyc lone damage to property will ten d to rise with  wealth , but mortality effects \\nmay fall co nsiderably.  Extreme events a re excluded from  all but a few st udies in relation  to valuation .   \\n \\nMajor Events , i.e. th e risk  of major effects - potentially ca tastrophic effects o r major climate d iscontinuities are \\nthe m ost uncertain category.

This is approxim ately equal to a median of Eu ro 4/tCO 2, \\na mean of Euro 25/tCO 2, and a 95 percentile of Eur o 96/tCO 2.  For this review, we consider the mean \\nis the appropriate esti mator of central te ndenc y; given the ri ght-sk ewed distribu tion t he mode and the \\nmedian will b oth be biased towards low valuations.  Using the weights favoured by  authors, the mean \\nis $129/tC and the 95 percentile $635/t C33 . Studies with a lower discount rate had hig her estim ates \\nand m uch gre ater range. Si milarly , studies that use equit y weightin g have hi gher esti mates and a larger  \\nrange. Studies that ar e peer-reviewed have lower estimates and  smaller uncertainty  ranges.  The \\nhighest estimates are in the grey literature. In his pa per, Tol concluded t hat the  marginal damage costs \\nof carbon dioxide em issions are unlikely  to exceed $50/ tC (14 Euro/tCO 2), and are probably m uch \\nsmaller.   \\n \\nThe trend in t he data is towards lower values over time, as shown in the figure above. The r eason for  \\nthe drop in the esti mated values over t he past de cade is be cause  of more recent cli mate scenarios, \\nconsideration of explicit so cio-econom ic reference scenarios (generally  of wealthier futures), inclusio n \\nof benefits as well as impacts, and no tably due to autonom ous adaptation ( which allows econom ic \\ncosts to be off-set in anticipation of  climate change).  Based on t his newer literature, so me \\ncommentators conclude that the social costs of clim ate change are low: with t ypical assu mptions about  \\ndiscounting and aggregation, the central esti mate of the marginal damage cost of carbo n dioxide  \\nemissions may be lower than the marginal abat ement costs for post-Ky oto scenarios (Euro 20/tCO 2) \\nand possibly below the estimated marginal abate ment cost to  Europe of meeting Ky oto (Euro  \\n12/tCO 234\\n).  However, it should be not ed that such tr ends may change in future analy sis.  Tw o \\nemerging findings are that cli mate sensitivit y and l ikelihood of severe i mpacts increases at lower \\ntemperature t hresholds m aybe higher than previously expected35. \\n \\nMoreover, the studies do not cover all  the im pact categories described above, and m ost research ers \\n(and indeed t he IPCC) consider the possibilit y of nega tive surprises are more likely  than posit ive ones.   \\nWe have ther efore as sessed the coverage of the valu ation studie s to investigate the extent to which \\nthey m ay under-esti mate th e “full” i mpacts of cli mate change. \\n \\n                                                      \\n33 The explanatio n of this incr ease is that some st udies (Azar and Sterner,  1996; Tol, 1999) deliber ately  reproduce the low \\nestimates of  Nordhaus (1994) and then  argu e that his assumptions are biased down wards. \\n34 The costs cons idered  are from the European Climate Ch ange Programme (ECCP 2001), which id entified  42 possible \\nmeasures, which  could lead to  some 664-765 MtCO 2 equivalent emissions reduc tions that could b e achieved at a cost lower \\nthan 20€/tonn e CO 2eq.

Valuation \\nstudies do not include the full list of all i mpacts.  It is important to take account of these differ ences in  \\nreviewing the values above, to ensure we are co mparing like with like, and to assess the coverage of  \\nthe m odelling esti mates against all like ly im pacts of cli mate chan ge.  We have  reviewed the studies  \\nagainst a risk m atrix36.  This  matrix separ ates cli mate c hange im pacts, and valuation of those im pacts, \\ninto nine individual categories, describe d below: \\n \\nCategories of impacts \\nThe IPCC TAR shows three main cat egories of cli mate change , with different confidence levels, \\nwhich are: \\n• Projections .  For exam ple, with respect to (relatively ) predictable t rends such as  sea level ri se or \\naverage global te mperature rises. \\n• Bounded risks .  Other ele ments ar e less clear, but w hich generally  fall within a range that can be \\nassigned approxim ate probabilities, for exam ple, the change in the probabilit y of summer drought.   \\n• Syste m chan ge and surprises .  For example, the i mpacts r elated to large sc ale dy namics and \\nregional feed backs that are currently  beyond our ab ility to predict with much confidence, such as  \\nalterations of North Atlant ic Circ ulation, collapse of the West Antarctic I ce Sh eet, or rel ease of \\nmethane hy drates. \\n \\nValuation of impacts \\nThere is a similar range o f confidence in our abilit y to provi de robust estimates of econom ic damages. \\nThe categories can be split into: \\n• Market damages,  where we have high confidence, for exam ple with respect to traded goods such \\nas for agriculture;  \\n• Non-market damage, which is further split int o \\no Non-market goods where valuation is  undertaken , for exam ple with valuation of  health \\nor ecosy stems; and  \\no Socially contingent effect s, such as regional confli ct or povert y, where we are try ing to \\ncapture large-scal e dynamics rel ated to hum an values and equit y that are poorl y \\nrepresented i n valuation es timates. \\n \\nA risk-based approach com bines both of these asp ects, i.e. the n ature of unce rtainty  in climate change  \\nwith the ele ments of eco nomic valuati on.  Such a risk matrix sh own provides so me structu re to the \\nsearch for more robust esti mates of the costs of cli mate change, and helps infor m what i s covered in \\nthe current econom ic values, and what is not.  It provi des a holistic approach for addressing categories \\nnot covered by integrated asses sment models and not li kely to be covered in the foresee able future.   \\n \\n                                                      \\n36 Downing, T., and Watkiss, P.

This lies in th e choice of \\na nu mber of  key  assu mptions.  Indeed, much of t he variation in esti mates arise  from a few  key \\nparam eters in  the choice of decision perspectives, most im portantly : \\n• Discount rate used; \\n• Approach to weighting impacts in di fferent regions (equit y weighti ng); \\n• The time peri od of em issions; \\n• Study time-horizon; \\n• Strong or weak sustainability approach;  \\n• Ancillary  benefits. \\n \\nThese para meters are discu ssed below.   \\n \\nDiscount Rate \\n \\nAs impacts of cli mate change take place in the futur e, the discount rate used is of major i mportance.  \\nThe discount rate39 (see box) used can have an extremely  large im pact on the social cost o f carbon .  \\nMany of t he earlier studies are based on studies that  use a 1% or 3% discount rate40.  The difference \\nbetween these two discount rates has a dram atic impact on the v alue; for exam ple, using the original  \\nExternE result, a switch from  a 3%  discount rate to  1% rate in creases the central value from  Euro  \\n20/tCO 2 (3% d.r.) to 44/tC O2 (1% d.r.)41.   \\n \\nMost i mpact assessment modelling studies present results  in ter ms of the pure rate of ti me preference \\n(PRTP), as th is is the fundam ental parameter.  The social rate of tim e preference is given b y the pur e \\nrate of ti me preference plus the per capi ta GDP gr owth rate multiplied by  the ne gative of the elasticity \\nof utilit y with respect to consum ption, which is a pa rameter used to determ ine the equit y weights. This \\nalso allows t he use of different growth rates in different regions, an im portant aspect for non -OECD \\nanaly sis.  When studies use a PRTP of 0%, they ar e still discounti ng but onl y to account for  the extr a \\nwealth that future generations will enjoy .   \\n \\n                                                      \\n39 ‘Discounting is a techn ique us ed to compare costs and benefits th at occur in differ ent time periods .

The UK HM Treasury  Green Book \\nguidance  recommends t hat the SR TP be used as  the standard real discount rate. \\n \\nThe STPR has two main elements: \\n\\x89 The rate at which individuals discount future consumption over present consumption, on the assumption of \\nan unchanging level of consum ption per capi ta over time.  Th is is th e so-called ‘pure rate of ti me \\npreference’ (PRTP) .  Th e Green Book suggests a PRTP value of around  1.5 per cent a year  for the near \\nfuture. \\n\\x89 An additional element, if p er capita co nsumption is ex pected to grow over time, reflecti ng the fact th at these \\ncircu mstances imply future co nsumption will be plentiful relativ e to the current position and thus have lower \\nmarg inal utility. Th is effect i s represented by th e product of the annual growth in per cap ita con sumption (g) \\nand the elasticity o f marginal utility  of consumption (µ) with resp ect to  utility.  Th e Green  Boo k indicates  \\nthe ann ual rate o f g is 2 per cent per year, and the elasticity o f the marginal utility o f consumption (µ) is \\naround 1. \\n \\nSRTP is the sum of these two com pone nts \\n \\nSRTP = PRTP + µ*g \\n \\nWith a pure time p referen ce rate of 1.5%, and values of 2% of g and  1 for µ, th e resu lting reco mmended discount \\nrate is 3.5%. A similar v alue is used in European po licy app raisal, with a SRTP of 4%. \\n \\nSource: Gree n Book.  HM Treasury.  \\n \\n \\nThere has also been a recent shift in the literature to wards declining discount r ates.  For exam ple, the \\nUK HMT Green Book reco mmends a discount rate of 3.5%  for projects up to 3 0 years with a  \\ndeclining schedule thereaft er.   \\n \\nPeriod of  years 0–30  31–75  76–125  126–20 0 201–30 0 301+  \\nDiscount  rate  3.5% 3.0% 2.5% 2.0% 1.5% 1.0% \\n \\nSource: Gree n Book.

The IP CC (in it’ s \\nsummary  for polic y makers) recognises that ‘the i mpacts of cli mate change will fall disproport ionately \\nupon developing countries and the poor persons within all countries, and thereby  exacerbate inequities \\nin health status and access to adequate food, clean water, and other resources.’  \\n \\nThe disproportionate im pacts of cli mate change on de veloping countries occurs because: \\n• These countries are exposed to significant climatic threats;  \\n• Their economies rely  more heavily on cli mate-sensitiv e activities;  \\n• They  are close to environmental tolera nce li mits; an d the y are poorly  prepared to adapt to c limate  \\nchange.   \\n \\nIn contrast, r icher societies tend to be better ab le to adapt, their econom ies ar e less dependent on \\nclimatic resources, and cli matic hazard s are less di sruptive to econom ic growth.  There are issues in \\napplying CBA for climate change, where im pacts are spread across countries with very different \\nincome level s. An aggregate e stimate of the i mpacts of cli mate change inevitably  implies combining \\nbenefits and disbenefits ac ross winners and losers. \\n \\nThere are different way s of aggregatin g econom ic effects in different countries or regions, and this \\ninfluences the global values.  This has been a ma jor source of contention in the climate change \\nvaluation dis cussion.  For exam ple, studies which have adjusted willingness to pay  (WTP)  estimates \\nfor incom e differentials acr oss regions us ing local values have led to m ajor debate43.  As a result , there  \\nhas been a shift towards the aggregation of m onetised im pacts using so-called equity weights \\n(distributio nal weights).  By  usin g equ ity weighti ng, we are able to take into account how the costs \\nand benefits accrue to different groups i n society.  Generally  polici es that deliver greater net benefit t o \\nindivi duals in  lower income groups are rated more fa vourabl y than those t hat benefit highe r.  Eq uity \\n                                                      \\n43 When aggreg ated, this implies lower m onetar y valua tion for  a life los t in B angladesh for ex ample, than in the for exam ple \\nin Europ e  This approach  has led to criticism  in interna tiona l policy  discussions, and raises the issue of how  to be consistent  \\nin policy  development be tween domestic and  international  expenditure.   \\nAEA Technol ogy Environment, August 2005 36', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\final_report2_en.pdf', 'page': 46}), Document(page_content='The Impacts and Costs of Climate Change \\n \\nweights can therefore be used to explici tly recogni se distributional effects within a polic y’s net present \\nvalue.  In the  case of cli mate change, we are try ing to recognise t hat vul nerable societies ar e likel y to \\nsee significant i mpacts,  and therefore that climate change mitigation poli cy will have a dis-\\nproporti onately larger benefit to these groups. T he equit y weighting scheme adopted m akes a very \\nlarge differen ce to the over all values, for  example, the approach used on how to aggregate between th e \\nwinners (e.g., agriculture i n Finland) and the loser s (e.g. sea-l evel rise in the  Maldives or B angladesh) \\ncan alter the e stimates by almost an or der of m agnitude (i.e. b y ten ti mes). \\n \\nEssentially , the more weight we put on the distribution of the im pacts fro m cli mate change, the more \\nsevere the ag gregate i mpacts are estimated to be. As  a result, the global pictur e depends on  how we \\naggregate. If we count in  numbers of Euros, u nder some types of  aggregation  scheme the world as a \\nwhole may  appear to lose a little.  If we count i n terms of num bers of people a nd associated phy sical \\ndamages, the losses beco me apparent.   \\n \\nThere is no consensus on equit y weigh ting appr oach es for cli mate change.  There may be different \\ntheoretically  correct approaches depending on the policy perspective and appl ication.  A d ifferent \\napproach might be warranted fro m an in dividual m ember state  policy  perspective, as distinct from the \\nperspective of a global policy  maker.  A more detailed  summary  of this issue is presented below44. \\n \\nIn a pure util itarian fram ework, equit y weighting is  based upon the diminishi ng marginal utility of \\nconsumption .  Evi dence on the appr opriate value of  the elasticity  of m arginal utilit y (ε), can be foun d \\nfrom  a variet y of sources.  However, no definitive guidance exists on the correc t value, whic h can be \\nregarded as a n ethical parameter. \\n \\nA value of ε = 1 is co mmonl y employed in the literature.  Some commentators have highlighted that  \\nthis is not consistent with the current rate of sp ending on foreign aid in individ ual member states (e.g. \\nPearce, 2003) .  Given current rates of foreign aid, a value of ε closer to zero, if not negativ e, would \\nemerge.   Ho wever, this d oes not nece ssarily  mean such values  are appropriate for (inter national) \\nclimate change polic y. \\n \\nThe appropri ate course of action depend s strongl y on the perspective of the decision m aker.   \\n• If we take the perspective o f a global decision m aker, equit y weighting at ε ≤ 1 may be appropr iate \\nfor damages.   \\n• If we employ a strict member state per spective c onsistent with MS spending in  other polic y areas, \\nparticularly  foreign aid, t hen equit y weighting is diffi cult to justif y. \\n \\nThere are three possible reasons why  climate cha nge and stand ard dom estic (or Euro pean) policies \\nmay differ in their approach to equity  weighting.  These ar e: (1) Cli mate change is intergenerational  \\nand there is no reliable mechanism of intergenerati onal transfers; (2) It is  non-m arginal, so  apply ing \\nthe Kaldor-Hicks rule may not be wi se; and (3) It is i nternational, a nd there is n o internationa l taxation \\nsystem .  Any policy  that satisfies  one of these thre e issues could be argued to have a cl aim to equity  \\nweighting. T his would inc lude foreign aid but argua bly other do mestic and in ternational policies with \\ninternational or intergenerationa l consequences (e.g. a gricultural su bsidies or biodiversity policies)45. \\n \\n                                                      \\n44 Based on a shor t note commissi oned for  the stud y. ‘Equ ity weighting of  climate change d amages: Where do we stand ?’ \\nCameron Hepbu rn.

It is ge nerally accepted that each \\nadditional unit of consumption provides diminishing marginal utility. \\nThat is, giving 1 Euro to a rich pe rson produce s less \\nutility ( welfare or happiness may su bstitute as rou gh \\nequivalents) than gi ving 1 Euro to a poor person.  So, \\nutility in creases with  consumption, but at a decreasi ng \\nrate.  A co mmo n way to  represen t this is wh en utility,  \\nu, of consumption, c, i s represent ed by an isoelastic \\nutility fu nction: u(c) = c(1-ε)/(1-ε), whe re ε denotes the \\nelasticit y of marginal utility.   \\n \\nIn this fun ction, th e higher ε, the m ore rapidly  \\nmarg inal utility falls with  additional wealth.  In  other \\nwords, a high ε implies th at th ere is little  additional \\nutility g ained from additional consumption by people \\nwho are already rich. A higher ε therefore implies a \\nhigher av ersion  to in equality. Utility functi ons fo r different ε \\n \\nConsumption Utility \\nHigh ε Low ε \\nThe i mpact of di fferent choi ces for ε can be  shown by considering two countries, one rich (R ) and one poor (P).  \\nSuppose c ountry R has an i ncome ten tim es that of co untry P. The t able bel ow, adapted from Pearce (2 003), \\nshows t he value o f a marginal Euro  to R relativ e to a marginal Euro  to P.  For ε = 0 (no equity weighting), a Euro \\nto R is worth  the sam e as a E uro to P.  For ε = 1.0 (commonly em ployed in the literatu re), g iving 10 cents to P \\nachieves the same u tility increase as g iving 1 Euro  to R: marg inal income to  P is v alued ten times more highly \\nthan to R. \\n \\nImpact of equit y weighting when Y R = 10Y P \\nε 0.0 0.5 0.8 1.0 1. 2 1..5 2.0 4.0  \\nLoss to R as a f ractio n of gain to P 1.0 0.31 0.16  0.10  0.06  0.03 0.01  ~0  \\n  Hence even tho ugh a pu re utilitarian  would not weight utility, a u tilitarian  would weig ht consumptio n flows \\nbecause of the dim inishing marginal utilit y of consum ption.  These we ights on consum ption flows are termed \\nequity weigh ts and the appropriate equ ity weig ht for con sumption going to country R  is (YN/YR)ε, where Y N  is a \\nbenc hmark (or numeraire) income level.  The equi ty weight for c onsumption going to P is equi valently (Y N/YP)ε.  \\nThe numeraire level is important and is discussed further below.   \\n \\nEvide nce on the correct  value of ε could come from : (a) l ab experiments o n individual behaviour; (b) reveal ed \\npreferences o f individuals; (c) reveal ed social prefere nces by government spen ding on programs desi gned to \\nreduce i nequal ity in the m ember states; (d) Mem ber state or Eu ropean go vernment spending on programs \\ndesigned to assist other countries. \\n \\nBased on evidence of individual behaviour in categories (a) and (b), Cowell and Gardiner (1999) suggest that \\nvalues between 0.5 and 4 are plausible. After exam ining social programs in category (c), Pearce  (2003) a rgues \\nthat values above ε = 2 a re unreas onable because t hey im ply an  unrealistically high level of aversion to \\ninequality.  Pearce (19 99) concludes that values between  0.5 and 1.2  seem  reason able. Fin ally, cursory \\ninspect ion of foreign ai d spending in category (d) would suggest that even ε = 1 i s extremely high – for example \\nmember state gove rnments spend m ore on its relatively rich citizens tha n on ai d to relatively poor pe ople in othe r \\ncountries.  Howev er, this finding simply reflects th e inapplicab ility o f the global utilitarian  ethic to the interests \\nof individual nation-st ates. \\n \\nThere  is another aspect to equity weighting which should also be considered. In standard economic model s, the \\nelasticit y ε used in equ ity wei ghting is th e same p arameter as  appears in the Social Ra te of Tim e Preference: \\nSRTP = PRTP + ε * g \\nwhere PRTP i s the Pure Rat e of Tim e Preference, ε is the negative of the marginal elasticit y of utility with \\nrespect  to consumption, a nd g is the per capita GDP growth rate.

The i mpact and cost s of cli mate change are sensitive to \\nthe time horizon chosen, i.e. essentially  whether the hazar ds of the re mote future are considere d or not, \\nthough these effects are dam pened by  discounting (es pecially  at hi gher discount  rates).  \\n \\nSome models have now st arted to lo ok at the e ffects of tim e-scale.  A longer m odelling time-s cale \\nclearly  increases the unc ertainty , partly  because of the uncertainty  about the scenarios and partly \\nbecause par ameter  uncert ainties a ccumulate over time.  M any models ar e therefore ext ending the  \\nlifetim e to 2200 or even 2300.  What is clear is th at the effects of extendi ng the tim e horizon, even \\nwith discount ing, can substantially  incr ease the estim ated margi nal cost of emissions in t he period \\n2000- 2100.

However, the data may not b e drawn fro m a single \\npopulati on and the m ean is sensitive to the tails of the distribution.   \\n \\nThis is im portant for the estimation of cli mate cha nge i mpacts as th e models sho w that the distribution \\nis right skew ed, i.e. the mean is higher than the median value46 and there are often outliers.  The  \\nmedian is less sensitive to  outliers, and has been regularly quoted in literature studies, but i s biased \\ntowards lower values when the probabi lity distribut ion has a long, high- value tail (as with  clim ate \\nchange im pacts – note this may have led to bias in so me of the values published .).  \\n \\nStrong and Weak Sustainability  \\n \\nIn looki ng at any social co st of clim ate change valu e, it is extremely  important t o realise what is, and \\nis not, includ ed in the value.  It is also im porta nt to understand the trade-o ffs implicit in the num bers, \\ni.e. between different regions, or between different positive and negative effect s.   \\n \\nThe use of a single aggregated value i mplies an  assu mption about substitution between cat egories of  \\nimpact.  The existing m odels, consistent with a co st-benefit analysis, assu me f ull substituta bility , i.e. \\nbetween very different im pact categories.  This may  mean that the aggregated econom ic cost is the net \\nof the losses from  for exam ple to damages to natu ral ecosy stems, against the positives, for exam ple \\nfrom  reduced energy for he ating.   \\n \\nIt is clear that different stakeholders will have  different views on whether such substitution will be \\nacceptable.  In order t o help exam ine these issu es, we propose that some detailed analy sis is \\nundertaken, showing the balance of positive and negativ e effects, by region (rather than single global  \\nvalues).   \\n \\nMarginal Effects \\n \\nFor polic y appraisal (cost- benefit analysis) we are i nterested in the marginal social costs o f climate \\nchange47. The marginal dam age cost is the dam age from  an additional to nne of CO 2 emitted.  \\nSpecifically , it is the change in the net present va lue of the monetised i mpacts, normalised  by the \\nchange in e missions.  The m odels used in the analy sis have been used to est imate the marginal social \\ncosts, i.e. the models are r un with and without addit ional pulses of em issions to assess the marginal  \\ncosts.  However, the underly ing analy sis within  the m odels, s uch as for loss of land, may  not \\nadequately  reflect scarcity , i.e. the models may be underestim ating the true marginal costs48.  There  \\nhave also be en concerns that so me of the potential changes fro m cli mate change are  clearly non-\\nmarginal (e.g . the risk of major change s to ocean  currents, major sea l evel rise  – note these are al so \\nnon-linear)49. Some co mmentators have responded t o this by arguing it still  possible to look a t \\nmarginal changes around polic y decisions in regard to climate change polic y, whilst recognising that \\nnon-m arginal im pacts are not full y repre sented.   \\n \\n                                                      \\n46 Measu res based on a cu mulative probability fun ction include the quartiles an d median.

The m ain structural  \\nchanges in PAGE2002 are the intro duction of  a thir d greenhouse g as and the incorporation  of possible  \\nfuture large-scale discontinuities into the im pact calcu lations of the model (IPCC, 2001a, p5) .

Finally , for non-econ omic impacts in bot h regio ns there is no tolerable  \\ntemperature r ise and adaptation can reduce the m by 25%. \\n \\nThe model has been used to assess the total i mpacts,  discounted back to a net present value, and the \\nmarginal soci al cost of car bon under dif ferent stabilis ation targets.  The total da mage values presented \\nare based on all global damages over a ti me horizon of 2200 and discounted back to a ne t present  \\nvalue.  The a nalysis for a business as  usual run is  based on the A2 sc enario.  The model has also  \\nassessed  550 ppm  and 450 ppm CO 2 concentrations levels.  These are broadly  equivalent to 550 ppm \\nand 650 pp m CO 2 equivalence (though PAGE includes stimulation of n atural CO 2 using IPCC \\nestimates of lower effecti ve uptake of CO 2 by oceans as the te mperature in creas es, so t he model \\nactually  predi cts higher inc reases).  The PAGE model uses a range of parameter s, including discount  \\nrate and equity  weighti ng.  For these runs, the mean values are for a mean discount rate o f 2% pure  \\nrate of ti me preferenc e (PRTP) and an elasticity  of utility with respect to consum ption of minus 1 (i.e. \\nan equity  weighted scenar io).  The value of a 2% PRTP) is broadly  consistent with the current EC  \\nrecommended discount ra te of 4% soci al rate of ti me preference (assu ming av erage GDP per capita \\ngrowth of  2%). Note the use of l ower discount  rates, or declinin g discoun t rate schemes would  give  \\nhigher values than presented here. \\n \\nMost i mpact assessment modelling studies present results  in ter ms of the pure rate of ti me preference \\n(PRTP), as th is is the fundam ental parameter.  The social rate of tim e preference is given b y the pur e \\nrate of ti me preference plus the per capi ta GDP gr owth rate multiplied by  the ne gative of the elasticity \\nof utilit y with respect to consum ption, which is a pa rameter used to determ ine the equit y weights. This \\nalso allows t he use of different growth rates in different regions, an im portant aspect for non -OECD \\nanaly sis.

The modelling of adap tation rem ains a major issu e that justifies further  \\nwork; ke y adaptation issues and areas fo r further work are discusse d below. \\n \\nAdaptation to cli mate chan ge is n eeded to prevent or lim it sever e damage to the environm ent, society \\nand econom ies and to help ensure sust ainable devel opment in the face of climate change.   Adaptation \\nis necessarily cross-cutting as it invol ves prom oting an understanding of how the changing cli mate \\nwill affect all  sectors in dif ferent way s in each count ry.  However, adaptation wi ll also incur  costs and \\nwill not preve nt all dam ages. \\n \\nPlanning for climate chan ge adaptation should begi n as soon as possible because anticipator y and \\nprecautionary adaptation is more effective and less  costly  than forced, last  minute, e mergenc y \\nadaptation or retrofitting (E EA 2004).  The abilit y of human sy stems to adapt to and cope w ith climate \\nchange depends on such factors as wealth, technology , education, inform ation, skills, infrastructure, \\naccess to r esources and management capabilities ( TAR 2001).  Developing countries have less of  \\nthese attributes and as a result have a lesser  capa city to adapt and are more vulnerable to cli mate \\nchange im pacts.   \\n \\nReviews of c limate chang e adaptation work56 have shown that climate change costing studies often  \\npay little attention to adaptation costs and m ore work needs to be com pleted in this area.

The average ancillary  benefit, \\ncalculated from  all studies presented in the table is approxim ately 27 Euro/tCO 2 (Defra 2002) .  Some \\ncare must be taken in comparing studie s, due to the differences in  methodology, analy sis techniques  \\nand dam ages included.  Thirteen out twenty  estimates of ancill ary benefits  from the literature are \\nbelow 20 Eu ro/tCO 2 and studies concentrating purel y on health i mpacts fro m a lim ited selection of  \\npollutants tend to report the lowest est imates.

Ther e is also the major benefit of reducing the risk of \\nmajor catastrophic events.  \\n \\nThe review here has shown that the inform ation on im pacts and econom ic costs is increasing. \\nHowever, th ere rem ain major information gaps a nd further rese arch is  needed to i mprove th e \\ninform ation available to fully  assess t he benefits o f policies.  From the info rmation avail able, we  \\nbelieve that m onetary  valuation of cli mate change policies is po ssible, and should be taken forward.   \\nHowever, w e also believe that care m ust be taken in presenting and inte rpreting the monetary \\nestimates, for  example by  avoiding the use of singl e simplistic estimates:  given the uncertainty  over \\nfuture scenar ios and im pacts, monetary valuation, and ethical and m oral issu es, there is no ‘single ’ \\nestimate of the social costs of climate change.  Further to this, we make a number of additional  \\nrecommendat ions that would im prove the analy sis presented here. \\n• Firstly , we reco mmend that work is undertaken to  present a more disaggregated analy sis of the \\nphysical im pacts of cli mate change, a nd the benefits of future polic y.   \\n• Secondl y, we reco mmen d that more disaggregat ed information is presented on the econom ic \\nvaluation of clim ate chan ge, showing the ba lance of positive and negative econom ic effects \\n(winners and losers) by i mpact category and regi on, rather tha n using single aggregated global \\nvalues.   \\n• Finall y, we reco mmend that the an alysis of fu ture policies should consider full sensitivity and \\nuncertainty  analysis, along with the i nform ation o f key  impacts, to allow t he co mparison of \\nbenefits against the possibl e costs of future mitigation policies.   \\n \\nTo progress these are as, w e reco mmend  a num ber of specific re search conclusions: \\n \\nFirst, some further work with the integrated asse ssment models: \\n• Additional m odel runs  with PAGE and FUND would be useful to test different future policies  \\n(towards sta bilisation targets for CO 2 equivalents of 400 p pm, 450 ppm , etc), with different \\nassumptions relating to baselines, discount rates, e quity weighti ng, and unce rtainty  anal ysis in \\nrelation to cl imate sensitivit y.  This should includ e analy sis of  long-term  benefits, but also the  \\nspecific benef its that would accrue fro m policies i mplem ented between 2010 and 2025.   \\n• It would also be extrem ely useful to run the models  to look at the marginal social costs of climate \\nchange in diff erent tim e periods, and for  different poll utants (e.g. CO 2, CH 4, N 2O).   \\n \\nSecondl y, to co mplement (and validate) the gl obal assessments with detailed sectoral st udies and \\nregional integrations: \\n• To undertake so me further analy sis to progress a di saggregated analy sis of the esti mates by region  \\n(including E urope vs. int ernational, and with the latter split b y region).  This would include  \\ndisaggregating the m odel outputs (e. g. from  FUND and PA GE), but also com paring  these  \\nestimates to others in the literature fro m the regional studies. \\n• To undertake so me further analy sis to pr ogress a di saggregated analy sis of the esti mates by impact \\ncategory  (e.g. health m ortality cases, changes in agri cultural production in tonnes, etc).  This  \\nwould include dis-aggregating the m odel outputs, bu t also com paring these esti mates to othe rs in \\nthe literature from  the regi onal studies.  \\n• There is a general need for the m odels to m ove towards more dynam ic analy sis of assessment, \\nboth for im pact assessment  (the dy namic processes of vulnerability  and adaptatio n) and valuation.   \\n \\nAEA Technol ogy Environment, August 2005 56', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\final_report2_en.pdf', 'page': 66}), Document(page_content='The Impacts and Costs of Climate Change \\n \\nThirdl y, to ex plore the m ain elem ents in the risk  matrix (above) that  are not well captured currently:  \\n• To extend the analy sis of bounded risks (e.g. in relation to floods, storm  damag e) and non-market \\nvaluation (e.g . health and e cosystems).  \\n• To undertake  scoping studies to assess t he potential magnitude of major events, e.g. Greenland ice \\nsheet, etc.  Some prelim inary work has been undertak en, but this i s a major area for future studie s \\nto focus, both for the ti ming of events (a nd rela tionship with different stabilisation levels) and the \\nimpacts.  The se are likely  to have a major im pact on the values. \\n• Similarly, to progress the understanding of, and potential m agnitude  of s ocially conti ngent \\nimpacts, particularly  looking at specific hot-spots such as Africa, Bangladesh, low  lying islands. \\n \\nThere are perhaps ten significant developments whic h are ongoin g or contem plated in the integrated \\nassessment c ommunity .  Reducing uncertainty in the geophy sical drivers of climate change include (i)  \\nimproving t he scal e of assessment and understanding a ggregation issues, (ii) li nking damage functions \\nto probabilist ic scenarios of cli mate change; (iii)  understanding cross-sectoral and multi-stressor  \\neffects and (iv) refining estimates of potentially  catastrophic impacts.  Reducing uncertaint y in \\neconom ic valuation includes: (1) adding new sector s to the damage functions; (2) broadening the  \\nrange of econom ic techniques (such as the prem ium attached to ris k aversion); ( 3) including additional  \\nmetrics that polic y maker may wish to take into  account; (4) bounding exercises to provide a first-\\norder estimate of the range of potential dam ages; (5) understanding the dynam ic aspects of \\nvulnerabilit y and adaptive capacity  and their relations hip to dam ages over ti me; and (6) expl oring the  \\neffects of alternative value sy stems, particularly  in the loss of non-m arket resources and non-marginal, \\nsocially  conti ngent effects.  Of course, these devel opments are continge nt upon im provements in  \\nclimate and i mpacts science, which we note below.  These  devel opments can be charted in  the risk  \\nmatrix. It is apparent that i mproving estimates rela ted to the larger uncertainties—the lower and right-\\nhand cells— requires s everal i mprove ments, and these may be the more difficult developm ents, \\nconstrained by the lack of data, the c hoice of ana lytical tools and the framing of clim ate polic y \\ndecisions. \\n \\nFinally , a num ber of additional aspects:  \\n• To further the analy sis of  adaptation c osts. Bo th FUND and PAGE include adaptation, and it  \\nwould be useful to separate out adaptation and dam age costs.  It would also be useful to un dertake \\na wider review and analy sis of the literature on adapta tion costs. \\n• Finall y, wor k to bri ng al l the im pact and valua tion data together in a form useful for policy \\nanaly sis (i.e. a multi-analysis framework).  We believe that fut ure polic y consi derations will nee d \\nto balance im pact analy sis, monetar y benef its, and work w ith significant uncertaint y and \\nsensitivity analy sis to allow inform ed decisions.  There is a need to develop a framework to \\nmaxi mise the usefulness of all the information for policy  makers.  \\n \\n \\nAEA Technol ogy Environment, August 2005 57', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\final_report2_en.pdf', 'page': 67}), Document(page_content='The Impacts and Costs of Climate Change \\n \\nRefer ences \\nACIA (2004).

It integrates the main findings of the Sixth \\nAssessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary \\nfor Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and \\nLong-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. \\nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse \\nforms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being \\nand sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. \\nBased on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of \\nconfidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. \\xa0\\n1 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \\nand Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication \\nrespectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.\\n2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \\nlevels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land \\ndegradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in \\na Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and \\n15 May 2019.\\n3 In this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.\\n4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of \\nconfidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence . The following terms are used to indicate the \\nassessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, \\nabout as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and \\nextremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely . This is consistent with AR5 and the other \\nAR6 Reports.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='4\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for PolicymakersA. Current Status and Trends\\nObserved Warming and its Causes\\nA.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 \\nin 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \\nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \\nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \\nbetween and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence ). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \\nFigure 2.2 }\\nA.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006, with larger increases \\nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two \\ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \\nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years ( high confidence ). \\n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1 }\\nA.1.2  The likely  range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \\n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely  that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \\na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \\nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \\nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C.  {2.1.1, Figure 2.1 }\\nA.1.3  Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \\nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO 2 \\nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 ( high \\nconfidence ).

Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate \\nextremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and \\nrelated losses and damages to nature and people ( high confidence ). Vulnerable communities \\nwho have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately \\naffected ( high confidence ). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3 } (Figure SPM.1 )\\nA.2.1  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by \\n0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr-1 between 1901 \\nand 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1 \\nbetween 2006 and 2018 ( high confidence ). Human influence was very likely  the main driver of these increases since at \\nleast 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical \\ncyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence \\nhas likely  increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of \\nconcurrent heatwaves and droughts ( high confidence ). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4 } (Figure SPM.1 )\\nA.2.2 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change.

Examples of effective adaptation options include: cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and \\nstorage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level \\ndiversification in agriculture, sustainable land management approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices \\nand other approaches that work with natural processes  (high confidence ). Ecosystem-based adaptation17 approaches \\nsuch as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing \\nflood risks and urban heat ( high confidence ). Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and \\nstructural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding  (medium confidence ).

There are widening disparities between the estimated costs \\nof adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation  (high confidence ). Adaptation finance has come predominantly \\nfrom public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an \\noverwhelming majority to mitigation  (very high confidence ). Although global tracked climate finance has shown \\nan upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance \\nsources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries ( high \\nconfidence ).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages \\nand through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, \\nparticularly for developing and least developed countries ( medium confidence ). {2.3.2, 2.3.3 }\\nBox SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report\\nModelled scenarios and pathways19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and \\npossible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables \\nand mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission \\npathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, \\nand have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about \\nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions \\nunderlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures.20 {Cross-Section Box.2 }\\nWGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)21 that \\ncover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and \\nvery high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.522) have CO 2 emissions that roughly double from current levels \\nby 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO 2 emissions remaining around \\ncurrent levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have \\nCO 2 emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2 \\nemissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate \\nchanges, impacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 \\npathways were categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways \\nthat limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to \\npathways that exceed 4°C (C8).  {Cross-Section Box.2 } (Box SPM.1, Table 1 )\\nGlobal warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related \\nimpacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and \\nindependent of timing when that level is reached. { Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n19 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI \\nprimarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when \\nreferring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.\\n20 Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The \\nother half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.\\n21 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the \\nscenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.  {Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n22 Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely  but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can \\nalso occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. { 3.1.1 }\\n23 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the \\nscenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not \\nidentical, with differences in concentration trajectories.

The mix of policy instruments that reduced costs and stimulated \\nadoption includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as \\ndeployment subsidies to attain scale.

This \\nwould make it likely  that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century ( high confidence ). Global modelled mitigation \\npathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming \\nimmediate action imply deep global GHG emissions reductions this decade ( high confidence ) (see SPM Box 1, Table 1, B.6)27. \\nModelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in \\nambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4] °C by 2100  (medium \\nconfidence ).

Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would \\nlead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also \\nto discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years  (high confidence ). \\n{Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.1, 4.3 } (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1 )\\nB.1.1  Global warming28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative \\nCO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more \\nlikely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely  or very likely  to \\nexceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates \\nof the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back \\nto below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed \\nclimate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range \\nfrom 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario \\n(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for \\ncorresponding scenarios in AR5. { Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3 } (Box SPM.1 )\\nB.1.2 Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 \\nand SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under \\nthese contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air \\nquality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions \\nreductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years \\ncompared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios \\nthat combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33.

Global surface \\ntemperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global \\nsurface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence ). The occurrence of individual years with global \\nsurface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached.  {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2 }\\n29 Median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is \\n2030–2035. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and \\n60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI ( medium confidence ). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), \\nthe midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5°C lies in the \\nfirst half of the 2030s.

The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability, coastal hazards, in-situ responses and planned relocation. \\nPlanned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlements. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, \\nmay or may not be considered to be adaptation.

However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise \\nacceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea \\nlevel rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15–0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28–0.55 m by 2100; while for the \\nSSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20–0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63–1.01 m by 2100 ( medium confidence ). Over the \\nnext 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to \\n2°C ( low confidence ). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4 } (Box SPM.1 )\\nB.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered \\nwhen tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming ( high confidence ). As warming levels increase, so \\ndo the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests ( medium confidence ), \\ncoral reefs ( very high confidence ) and in Arctic regions ( high confidence ). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and \\n3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, \\ncausing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence) . The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher \\nglobal surface temperatures ( high confidence ). {3.1.2, 3.1.3 }\\nB.3.3 The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global \\nwarming levels ( high confidence ).

There is medium confidence  that the Atlantic Meridional \\nOverturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt \\nshifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.  {3.1.3 } (Box SPM.1 )', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='19\\nSummary for PolicymakersSummary for PolicymakersAdaptation Options and their Limits in a Warmer World\\nB.4 Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and \\nless effective with increasing global warming.

When CO 2 is \\ncaptured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO 2 capture and \\nsubsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the \\npower sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option.

WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and \\ngeophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For \\npotential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and \\nlow. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime \\ndiscounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and \\ntime and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced \\nsinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios \\nfrom the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included \\nmostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching \\nto electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy \\ncontext dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options \\nfor 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the \\nsectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. \\nThe green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest \\nand the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use \\npatterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use \\nsectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional \\nenergy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows \\nthe projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, \\nthis projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural \\nfactors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).  {Figure 4.4 } \\nMitigati on and Adaptation Options across Systems \\nC.3\\tRapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve \\ndeep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. \\nThese system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and \\nadaptation options. Feasible, effective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation \\nare already available, with differences across systems and regions. ( high confidence ) {4.1, 4.5, \\n4.6} (Figure SPM.7 )\\nC.3.1\\tThe systemic change required to achieve rapid and deep emissions reductions and transformative adaptation to climate \\nchange is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed ( medium confidence ). Systems transitions \\ninclude: deployment of low- or zero-emission technologies; reducing and changing demand through infrastructure \\ndesign and access, socio-cultural and behavioural changes, and increased technological efficiency and adoption; social \\nprotection, climate services or other services; and protecting and restoring ecosystems ( high confidence ). Feasible, \\neffective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available ( high confidence ). The availability, \\nfeasibility and potential of mitigation and adaptation options in the near term differs across systems and regions ( very \\nhigh confidence ). {4.1, 4.5.1 to 4.5.6 } (Figure SPM.7 )\\nEnergy Systems \\nC.3.2 Net zero CO 2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil \\nfuels51, and use of carbon capture and storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no \\nnet CO 2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification; energy \\nconservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system ( high confidence ). Large contributions \\nto emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO 2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency \\nimprovements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) ( medium confidence ). There are \\nfeasible adaptation options that support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for \\nexisting and new energy generation systems  (very high confidence ). Energy generation diversification (e.g., via wind, \\nsolar, small scale hydropower) and demand-side management (e.g., storage and energy efficiency improvements) can \\nincrease energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change ( high confidence ). Climate responsive energy \\nmarkets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, smart-grid \\ntechnologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in \\nthe medium to long term, with mitigation co-benefits ( very high confidence ). {4.5.1 } (Figure SPM.7 )\\n51 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted \\nthroughout the life cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO 2 from power plants, or 50–80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply.', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf', 'page': 33}), Document(page_content='29\\nSummary for PolicymakersSummary for PolicymakersIndustry and Transport\\nC.3.3 Reducing industry GHG emissions entails coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation \\noptions, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement \\ntechnologies and transformational changes in production processes ( high confidence ). In transport, sustainable \\nbiofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives (including ammonia and synthetic fuels) can support mitigation of \\nCO 2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements \\nand cost reductions ( medium confidence ). Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based \\ntransport in the short and medium term ( medium confidence ). Electric vehicles powered by low-GHG emissions \\nelectricity have large potential to reduce land-based transport GHG emissions, on a life cycle basis ( high confidence ). \\nAdvances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional \\nelectric rail systems ( medium confidence ). The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns \\nabout critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency \\nimprovements, and circular material flows  (medium confidence ). {4.5.2, 4.5.3 } (Figure SPM.7 )\\nCities, Settlements and Infrastructure \\nC.3.4  Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development ( high \\nconfidence ). Key adaptation and mitigation elements in cities include considering climate change impacts and risks \\n(e.g., through climate services) in the design and planning of settlements and infrastructure; land use planning to \\nachieve compact urban form, co-location of jobs and housing; supporting public transport and active mobility (e.g., \\nwalking and cycling); the efficient design, construction, retrofit, and use of buildings; reducing and changing energy \\nand material consumption; sufficiency52; material substitution; and electrification in combination with low emissions \\nsources ( high confidence ). Urban transitions that offer benefits for mitigation, adaptation, human health and well-\\nbeing, ecosystem services, and vulnerability reduction for low-income communities are fostered by inclusive long-term \\nplanning that takes an integrated approach to physical, natural and social infrastructure ( high confidence ). Green/\\nnatural and blue infrastructure supports carbon uptake and storage and either singly or when combined with grey \\ninfrastructure can reduce energy use and risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, flooding, heavy precipitation and \\ndroughts, while generating co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods ( medium confidence ). {4.5.3 }\\nLand, Ocean, Food, and Water\\nC.3.5 Many agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) options provide adaptation and mitigation benefits that could \\nbe upscaled in the near term across most regions. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests \\nand other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical \\nregions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to \\ntrade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple \\nobjectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets53 and reducing food loss/\\nwaste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion, and methane and nitrous oxide \\nemissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agricultural and forest \\nproducts, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. \\nEffective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and \\nlandscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, \\nsocioeconomic and other enabling factors. Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems (e.g., peatlands, \\nwetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests), deliver immediate benefits, while others, such as restoration of high-carbon \\necosystems, take decades to deliver measurable results.

Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments can improve mitigation outcomes in \\nsectoral applications, consistent with national circumstances ( high confidence ). Where implemented, carbon pricing \\ninstruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures but have been less effective, on their own and \\nat prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions \\n(medium confidence ). Equity and distributional impacts of such carbon pricing instruments, e.g., carbon taxes and \\nemissions trading, can be addressed by using revenue to support low-income households, among other approaches. \\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions54 and yield benefits such as improved public revenue, \\nmacroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts, especially \\non the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases can be mitigated by measures such as redistributing \\nrevenue saved, all of which depend on national circumstances ( high confidence ). Economy-wide policy packages, such \\nas public spending commitments and pricing reforms, can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and \\nshifting development pathways towards sustainability ( medium confidence ).

If climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would \\nneed to increase many-fold. There is sufficient global capital to close the global investment \\ngaps but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action. Enhancing technology \\ninnovation systems is key to accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and \\npractices. Enhancing international cooperation is possible through multiple channels. ( high \\nconfidence ) {2.3, 4.8 }\\nC.7.1 Improved availability of and access to finance55 would enable accelerated climate action ( very high confidence ). \\nAddressing needs and gaps and broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, when combined \\nwith other supportive actions, can act as a catalyst for accelerating adaptation and mitigation, and enabling climate \\nresilient development ( high confidence ). If climate goals are to be achieved, and to address rising risks and accelerate \\ninvestments in emissions reductions, both adaptation and mitigation finance would need to increase many-fold  (high \\nconfidence ). {4.8.1 }\\nC.7.2 Increased access to finance can build capacity and address soft limits to adaptation and avert rising risks, especially for \\ndeveloping countries, vulnerable groups, regions and sectors ( high confidence ). Public finance is an important enabler \\nof adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance  (high confidence ). Average annual modelled \\nmitigation investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of \\nthree to six greater than current levels56, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) \\nwould need to increase across all sectors and regions ( medium confidence ). Even if extensive global mitigation efforts \\nare implemented, there will be a need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation ( high confidence ). \\n{4.3, 4.8.1 }\\nC.7.3 There is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close global investment gaps, given the size of the global financial \\nsystem, but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action both within and outside the global financial sector and \\nin the context of economic vulnerabilities and indebtedness facing developing countries. Reducing financing barriers for \\nscaling up financial flows would require clear signalling and support by governments, including a stronger alignment \\nof public finances in order to lower real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers and risks and improving \\nthe risk-return profile of investments. At the same time, depending on national contexts, financial actors, including \\ninvestors, financial intermediaries, central banks and financial regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-\\nrelated risks, and reduce sectoral and regional mismatches between available capital and investment needs.  (high \\nconfidence ) {4.8.1 }\\nC.7.4 Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors \\nand regions. These gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing countries.  \\nAccelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler \\nto enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms \\nand conditions, and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing countries. Scaled-up public grants for \\nmitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and \\nhave high social returns in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation in developing countries \\ninclude: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing \\ncountries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal; increased use of public guarantees to reduce risks and \\nleverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and building greater trust in international \\ncooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the longer-term \\ncan accelerate climate action, including in developing regions and countries facing high debt costs, debt distress and \\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.

Innovation and adoption of \\nlow-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker \\nenabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.  (high \\nconfidence ) {4.8.3 }\\nC.7.6 International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation, adaptation, and climate \\nresilient development ( high confidence ). Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation \\nincluding mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors \\nand groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs ( high \\nconfidence ). Enhancing international cooperation on finance, technology and capacity building can enable greater \\nambition and can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and adaptation, and shifting development pathways \\ntowards sustainability  (high confidence ). This includes support to NDCs and accelerating technology development and \\ndeployment  (high confidence ). Transnational partnerships can stimulate policy development, technology diffusion, \\nadaptation and mitigation, though uncertainties remain over their costs, feasibility and effectiveness ( medium \\nconfidence ).

These results are based on a set of consistent, spatially explicit scenarios of global \\nchange, a range of ecosystem models and indicators for ecosystem services, as well as \\na continuous dialogue with stakeholders. The bulk of scientific information on global change and its potential impacts in this report is drawn from analyses of the results of the ATEAM project. Moreover, we conducted surveys for the seven climate-sensitive \\nsectors in various regions of Germany, in order to assess the regional and sectoral \\nsignificance of potential impacts of climate change, and to develop suitable adaptation strategies to these potential impacts.  \\nTo assess vulnerability we integrated results from scenarios on potential impacts of \\nglobal change that were developed in ATEAM with findings from other studies, as well \\nas with results from our surveys. The re sults were discussed during several “Expert \\nTalks on Climate” (Klimafachgespräche), which were organised by the Federal Environment Agency and during a stakeholder workshop with representatives from government, administrative bodies, the economy, and the wider public. \\n1.1.2  Structure of the Report \\nChapter 1 is an introduction into the causes, the character and the general impacts of \\nglobal change. The interrelations between ecosystems, ecosystem services and society are elaborated.  Terms and concepts in the context of adaptation to climate change, \\nadaptive capacity and vulnerability are introduced and the state-of-knowledge \\nregarding these topics is summarised.  \\nThe concepts and methods this particular study is based on are introduced in chapter \\n2. Those are mainly the analyses of scientific studies, in particular the project ATEAM, as well as the experts’ survey on adaptation to climate change. \\nChapter 3 describes the characteristics of gl obal change in Germany. On the one hand, \\nwe analyse and evaluate observed climatic changes and various scenarios of future \\n                                              \\n \\n1 ATEAM – Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling (EU Project No. \\nEVK2-2000-00075), www.pi k-potsdam.de/ATEAM.

For this  we elaborate on particular climatic \\nvariables (temperature, precipitation), extreme events, as well as spatial and temporal variations of these phenomena. On the other hand, we discuss two other important elements of global change, i.e. land use changes and changes in atmospheric \\nconcentration of carbon dioxide. \\nChapter 4 is the central chapter of the report. Here we analyse impacts of global \\nchange (particularly climate change) and the state of adaptation to global change in \\nseven selected sectors (forestry, agriculture, water management, tourism, nature conservation, health, and transport), and draw conclusions on the vulnerability of \\nthese sectors. For this we analyse results from the project ATEAM and other studies, \\nas well as findings from the experts’ survey on adaptation.  \\nChapter 5 summarises the results of the stakeholder-workshop with representatives \\nfrom policy, administrative bodies and the economy that was conducted on adaptation \\nto climate change as part of this study. \\nChapter 6 contains conclusions and recommendation. Conclusions regarding \\nGermany’s vulnerability to climate change are drawn from the results presented in chapter 4. Highly vulnerable regions and sectors are identified. Recommendations on \\nthe communication of results on climate impacts, on how to deal with uncertainty in \\nclimate scenarios, and on the societal adaptation to climate change are given. \\nChapter 7 contains an English and German executive summary of the report. \\n1.2 Global Change \\n1.2.1  Global Climate Change – Historical Development \\nRate and degree of climate change in the 20th century are extraordinary – e.g. present \\ntemperatures in the Northern Hemisphere are probably the warmest since 2000 years (Moberg et al., 2005). In the Northern Hemisphere the 1990s were the warmest \\ndecade, and the years 1998, 2002 and 2003 were the warmest years in the last \\nthousand years (IPCC, 2001; WMO, 2003) (Fig. 1-1). Since 1900, global mean \\ntemperature has risen by 0.7 ± 0.2 ºC. Precipitation in the middle and higher latitudes \\nof the Northern Hemisphere has risen by  0.5 to 1% per decade during the 20\\nth \\ncentury, while it declined in the subtropica l latitudes. Furthermore, climate extremes \\nwere observed more frequently, such as fo r example an accumulation of temperature \\nanomalies in the Pacific Ocean since 1970 (so called “El Niño events“) (IPCC, 2001). Since 1950, a profound increase of the damages due to natural hazards and flooding \\nhas been recorded (Munich Re, 2002).  \\nOnly a small fraction of this climate change can be explained by natural factors such as \\nvolcanic eruptions, changes in solar activity or deviations in the Earth’s orbit around \\nthe sun. Meanwhile, there is overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that \\nthe main cause of climate change is human activity, in particular the emission of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2001; Oreskes, 2004). In order to meet our energy \\ndemands, in a few generations we are using up fossil fuels that took hundreds of \\nmillions of years to form. In doing so we produce greenhouse gases, such as for example carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide \\n(CO\\n2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) reflect part of Earth’s heat radiation \\n(infrared radiation) and thereby cause a “greenhouse effect” that is warming the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. \\nSince the beginning of industrialisation the atmospheric concentration of the most \\nimportant greenhouse gas CO\\n2 has risen by 34% from 280 to 375 ppm (parts per \\nmillion), due to burning of fossil fuels and land-use change, and has probably reached \\nits highest level in 400’000 years (Petit et al., 1999). Over the same time the \\nconcentration of methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, has even risen by more than 150%. In the absence of drastic measures to reduce emissions, the \\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is expected to double even within the next \\nfew decades (to almost 600 ppm, relative to pre-industrial level; IPCC, 2001).

Cimate sensitivity, that  is the rise in temperature following a \\ndoubling of the CO\\n2 concentration, is assumed to lie between 1.5 and 4.5ºC globally. \\nThe probability of overshooting the 2-degree target in the long term rises rapidly \\nunder concentrations that lie much higher than today’s values (Hare & Meinershausen, 2005). To reach the 2-degree target, today’s global emissions need to be lowered from \\n7 Gt carbon per year to 2 Gt per year (Jaeger & Oppenheimer, 2005). This is a \\nformidable challenge, in view of the emissi ons of the United States of America and of \\ndensely populated countries such as India an d China that also exhibit rapid economic \\ngrowth. The projection of emission trajectori es is very uncertain. In this study we use \\nthe SRES scenarios published by the IPCC. They do not consider any explicit climate policy, but nevertheless embrace a range of em issions that are possible in the light of \\ntoday’s climate policy strategies. \\nThe IPCC acts on the assumption of the continued increase of all greenhouse gas \\nconcentrations to values of between 650 and 1215 ppm CO\\n2-equivalents. The carbon \\ndioxide concentration alone will therefore ri se to values of between 607 and 958 ppm, \\nranging between a doubling and a tripling of pre-industrial levels (Nakicenovic & Swart, 2000). In consequence, a continued, accelerated rise in global mean \\ntemperature by 1.4-5.8ºC is expected by  the year 2100 (Fig. 1-1). Global average \\nprecipitation is expected to rise slightly, with a very heterogeneous distribution over space and time. \\nExact prediction of extreme clime events is currently impossible. However, extreme \\nweather and climate events, such as hot summer days, summer drought and extreme ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='- 16 -  \\n rainfall will probably or very probably occur more frequently during the 21st century \\n(IPCC, 2001). Moreover an increase in cyclone activity in the tropics is likely. A decrease in cold extremes is very likely.  \\n1.2.3  Climate Change in Europe \\nSince 1990, global mean temperature has risen by 0.7 ± 0.2 ºC. During the same \\nperiod, Europe has experienced and even stronger warming, namely by 0.95ºC (EEA, \\n2004). Similar to the global trend, temperatures have risen more strongly during \\nwinter than during summer. The warming was most pronounced in Northwestern Russia and on the Iberian Peninsula. Climat e projections for Europe show a warming \\nby 2.0-6.3ºC from 1990 to 2100. The “sustain able” EU-goal of a global warming by a \\nmaximum of 2ºC in comparison to pre-indu strial temperatures will probably be \\nsurpassed already by the year 2050 (EEA, 2004). \\nClimate observations during the years 1900-2000 exhibit a rise in annual precipitation \\nin Northern Europe (10-40% wetter), and a decrease in Southern Europe (up to 20% dryer). In most European regions these changes were most pronounced during winter \\n(EEA, 2004). Climate projections show a rise in annual precipitation in Northern \\nEurope by 1-2% per decade, and a decrease in annual precipitation by 1% per decade \\nin Southern Europe (during summer, decrea ses of up to 5% per decade can occur). \\nFor Southern Europe serious water shortages and increased frequency of droughts are \\nexpected. \\nDuring the last one hundred years, the number of frost days has decreased in most \\nEuropean regions. At the same time, the number of summer days (temperatures above 25ºC) and heat waves has increased. In Central and Northern Europe, the frequency of extremely wet days has risen in  recent decades, but in Southern Europe \\nit has decreased significantly in many locations. Cold winters (defined as winters that \\nare colder than 90% of all winters during the period of 1961-1990) will, according to scenario calculations, vanish almost entire ly by 2080, while hot summers (defined as \\nsummers that are hotter than 90% of all summers during the period of 1961-1990) \\nwill be much more frequent. Moreover, it is likely that until 2080 both droughts and extreme rainfall events will be more frequent in Europe (EEA, 2004). \\nThe glaciers in eight out of nine European glacier regions are declining, in accordance \\nwith the global trend. The current retreat of glaciers surpasses the extent of the last 5000 years. It is very probable that this trend will continue. Until the year 2050, \\nprobably ca. 75% of the glaciers in the Swiss Alps will have disappeared. In addition, \\nbetween 1971 and 1994, the duration of snow cover of the Northern Hemisphere \\n(between 45º and 75º latitude) has decrease d by an average 0f 8.8 days per decade. \\nAccording to climate scenarios, this trend will continue through the 21\\nst century (EEA, \\n2004). \\n1.2.4  Other Drivers of Global Change \\nGlobal change is a far-reaching and widely used collective term. We understand this \\nterm not only to refer to climate change, but also to trends in other factors that reflect \\nhuman influence on the Earth system, i.e. the era of the so-called Anthropocene  \\n(Crutzen, 2002). \\nThe intensive use of our planet leaves traces  in our environment. For example, by now \\nhumans have altered 30-50% of the Earth’s surface (Vitousek et al. 1997b). The global \\npopulation is growing; in the year 2050 probably 2-4 billion more people will inhabit \\nthe planet (Cohen, 2003). The production of  fertilisers today binds more nitrogen \\nthrough synthetic nitrogen fixation than the entire natural fixation of all terrestrial ecosystems (Vitousek, 1997a). \\nThe research project reported here has primarily focussed on the global change drivers \\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, climate change and land-use change.

Ecosystems and society are \\ntherefore inseparable. The wealth of ecosystem services (including goods), such as \\ne.g. food and fodder production, fresh wa ter retention, climate regulation, soil \\nformation, inspiration and aesthetic value of landscapes is quite overwhelming. It is therefore practical to aggregate ecosystem services into four categories: provisioning, \\nregulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services (see Tab. 1-1). \\nTab. 1-1: Aggregating ecosystem services into four categories, short explanations and \\nexamples (Source: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). \\n Provisioning ecosystem \\nservices Regulating ecosystem \\nservices Cultural ecosystem \\nservices \\nProducts obtained from \\necosystems.

This term stresses, that humans as users, actors \\nand managers are not external to the environment, but act as integral parts of the \\nsystem. Within the human-environment system, ecosystem services form a vital link between humans and their environment. We understand climate-sensitive systems as human-environment systems and choose ecosystem services as point of \\ndeparture of this assessment. \\n1.3.2  Past and Current Impacts of Global Change on \\nEcosystem Services and Society \\nGlobal change influences ecosystems through changes in process rates and system \\nstructure (Schröter et al., 2004b). The impacts of global change on ecosystems and \\ntheir services have become apparent on various scales. Anthropogenic climate \\nchange has left a “fingerprint” on ecosystems – the distribution of many species has shifted pole-wards (or to higher altitudes), and biological spring (e.g. bud break of \\ntrees and spring arrival of birds) arrives earlier in the year (Parmesan & Yohe, 2003; \\nStenseth et al., 2002; Walther et al., 2002). It is neither surprising nor new that climate change impacts animal and plant species. However, rate and degree of these impacts are greater than ever before (Root et al., 2003). Over the past few hundred ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='- 18 -  \\n years, humans have increased the species extinction rate by as much as 1000 times \\nover background rates typical over the planet’s history (Reid et al., 2005). Moreover, the distribution of species is becoming more homogenous; in other words regions are becoming less characteristic with respect to the species they host. \\nIn the 140 years between 1850 and 1990, global land use change has led to an \\nincrease in agricultural area (from ca. 13 to 49 million km\\n2). This change took place \\nat the expense of forest area (decrease from globally ca. 60 to 48 million km2) and \\ngrassland (decrease from globally ca. 60 to 36 million km2) (McNeill, 2001). The \\nmain part of these dramatic changes happened in the last sixty years. This land use \\nchange was accompanied by massive soil erosion and caused profound changes in \\nthe global cycles of carbon and nutrients, such as e.g. phosphorus and nitrogen (Houghton, 1999; McNeill & Winiwarter, 2004).  Some studies estimate that the negative impacts of land use changes on global biodiversity will be even stronger \\nthan the impacts of climate change (Sala et al., 2000). Nitrogen deposition is \\nrecognised as the third important factor.  \\nToday, agricultural lands and forests receive up to sixteen times more nitrogen \\nthrough atmospheric deposition than prior to industrialisation (Holland et al., 1999). This leads to eutrophication and alters the structure and functioning of ecosystems \\n(Matson et al., 2002; Smith et al., 1999). In aquatic systems, the eutrophication \\neffect becomes visible quickly, through algal blooms and the dying of freshwater \\nsystems. Forests react more slowly. Often an increased in forest growth is observed at first, until the supply of nitrogen surpasses the demand, and nitrogen ions start \\nbinding other essential nutrients in the forest soil (e.g. calcium and magnesium). \\nTogether they are then leached into the groundwater. As a result, nutrient-deficient trees are more susceptible to frost, drought and parasites. The accompanying \\nacidification poses a threat to soil biodiversity (Aber et al., 1998). In spite of the \\nGothenberg Protocol (1999) for the reduction of sulphur and nitrogen emissions, nitrogen deposition on central European ecosystems will remain very high (Alcamo et \\nal., 2002). The long-term effect of this involuntary permanent fertilisation is \\ncurrently unknown. \\nGlobal change alters the basic conditions for ecosystem functioning (soil formation, \\nnutrient cycling, primary production, see also “supporting ecosystem services”, Tab. \\n1-1) and consequently influences all other ecosystem services indirectly. Furthermore, global change directly impacts biodiversity and landscape diversity \\n(biodiversity in the broader sense). In March 2005, the global ecosystem study \\n“Millennium Ecosystem assessment” was completed. One of the main findings of this unique study is that the global degradation of ecosystems is a barrier in achieving \\nthe Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations (Reid et al., 2005). Over \\n1300 scientists agreed that the global reduction of child mortality, the overcoming of extreme poverty and hunger, the combating of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as other development goals depend on the sustainable management \\nof the human-environment system. Furthermore, the degradation of ecosystem \\nservices leads to problems far exceeding a slight decrease in our high quality of life even in economically rich countries. Th e executive director of the European \\nEnvironment Agency (EEA) concludes: \\n“Climate change is already happening and has far-reaching impacts on people and \\necosystems in the whole of Europe, often in combination with profound economic \\nlosses” , Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of EEA. \\nThe devastating Elbe flood in 2002 was not only a consequence of extraordinarily \\nextreme rainfall events, but also of the lack of areas for water retention, such as e.g. \\nnatural polder areas. In this way the loss of water storing river-landscapes has become noticeable very abruptly. \\n1.3.3  The Concepts Vulnerability, Adaptation and Adaptive \\nCapacity \\nThe term “vulnerability“ refers to the potential of harm of the human-environment \\nsystem (see also Box 1-1). This study is about vulnerability to global change, in ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='- 19 -  \\n particular climate change. Global change influences humans directly (such as e.g. \\nthrough floods and heat waves) and indirectly through impacts of global change on climate-sensitive sectors (e.g. water or agriculture).  \\nVulnerability to current and future global change depends strongly on the initial \\nsituation. A region or sector is often already stressed today. Present basic climatic or environmental conditions can pose constraints (e.g. insufficient precipitation or poor \\nsoils in agriculture and forestry). Many sectors are influenced by changes in socio-\\neconomic basic conditions (e.g. agriculture, forestry, health, tourism, transport). Such \\nbasic conditions strongly determine a region’s or sector’s predisposition in the context \\nof global change and are decisive for the re gional differentiation of vulnerability.  \\nThe vulnerability of a human-environment syst em, a region, a sector to global change \\ndepends mainly on three factors, in addition to its predisposition: \\n• What are the characteristics of climate change and other elements of global \\nchange in the respective region? \\n• How large are the potential impacts of global change within the region on the \\nspecific sectors? \\n• What is the degree of adaptation in the sp ecific sectors within the region to the \\npotential impacts? \\nThe degree of adaptation depends on the implementation of adaptation measures, \\nwhich mitigate damages or capitalize on opportunities. \\nBox 1-1 – Definitions of central terms \\nMost of the following definitions are base d on the Third Assessment Report of the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001). \\nPotential impacts of global change  – All impacts that may occur given plausible \\nglobal change scenarios, without considerin g present or future planned adaptation.  \\nAdaptation to climate impacts  –Adjustment in natural or human systems in \\nresponse to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm \\nor capitalizes on beneficial opportunities (unchanged, IPCC, 2001). In contrast, \\nmitigation is the attempt to avoid or lessen climatic change.  \\nDegree of adaptation  – The extent of adaptation to current or future impacts of \\nglobal change. The degree of adaptation is determined by the existence of adaptation \\nmeasures, which moderates harm or capitalize on beneficial opportunities. \\nSpontaneous Adaptation (autonomous Adaptation)  – Adaptation through \\necological or biological changes in natural systems, as well as through market or \\nwelfare changes in human systems (Metzger & Schröter, 2005 (in review); Schröter et \\nal., 2004a). Spontaneous adaptation does not constitute a conscious or planned \\nresponse to global change. Examples of spontaneous adaptation : Tree species \\nextending their bioclimatic envelope through evolutionary adaptation; decreasing \\ndemand as a consequence of increased prices due to supply shortages. \\nAdaptive capacity  – The ability of a system to implement planned adaptation \\nmeasures (unchanged, IPCC, 2001). Adaptive capacity does not incorporate potential \\nspontaneous adaptation (autonomous adaptation). Example of adaptive capacity:  The \\nadaptive capacity of a region to flood hazards is high, if the regions has the political \\nwill, freedom, resources and know-how to build new flood polders etc. in expectation \\nof more frequent and more extreme flooding events. \\nVulnerability (to global change) – The likelihood of a specific human-environment \\nsystem to experience harm due to changes in society or the environment, accounting \\nfor its adaptive capacity (Turner et al., 2003). Examples of vulnerability: Settlements \\non flood polders are vulnerable to extreme rain events. In a different way, people who \\nuse natural river landscapes for their recreation and inspiration are vulnerable to land-\\nuse change such as river regulation. Elderly who lack a social network of care are very ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='- 20 -  \\n directly vulnerable to summer heat waves. \\nVulnerability without  further adaptation  (current vulnerability, business-as-usual \\nscenario) – Future risk of harm of a human-environment system due to global change \\n(particularly climate change) under the assumption that its degree of adaptation will \\nnot change in future. \\nVulnerability with further adaptation (improved-business scenario) – Future risk of \\nharm of a human-environment system due to global change (particularly climate \\nchange) under the assumption that present ad aptive capacity will be fully used to \\nimprove its degree of adaptation in future. \\n \\nA human-environment system is therefore only vulnerable, if it is not adapted to \\npotential impacts of global change. The degr ee of adaptation is determined by the \\nadaptive capacity of the human-environment system. Adaptive capacity is small, if \\nnecessary resources (financial, organisational, legislative, scientific etc.) are not \\navailable to realise a sufficient degree of adaptation. In this case, the human-\\nenvironment system will not be able to adapt to the impacts of global change. \\nVulnerability without further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario) results if the \\ncurrent degree of adaptation is maintained into the future. This kind of vulnerability is also referred to as current vulnerability . When assessing this vulnerability, we assume \\nthat no further adaptation measures be yond already existing ones (e.g. flood \\nprotection) are implemented. In this way we convey an impression of which damages are to be expected, if no further adaptati on to global change (particularly climate \\nchange) is achieved. \\nIf we assume that present adaptive capacity  will be fully used to improve the future \\ndegree of adaptation, we obtain vulnerability with further adaptation  (improved-\\nbusiness scenario). By comparing vulnerability without  further adaptation (business-\\nas-usual scenario) and vulnerability with further adaptation (improved-business \\nscenario) we obtain an impression of the risks of damages due to global change \\n(particularly climate change) with and without further measures of adaptation. \\n1.3.4  Adaptation Strategies and the Roles of Science and \\nPolicy \\nAdapting to changing environmental conditions is a natural part of our everyday live. \\nMostly, these adaptations are a reaction to changes that have already happened. Adaptation strategies , however, contain a perception of the future development of \\nevents. Global change is already reality. Fu rther climate change is inevitable, even if \\nwe implemented the best mitigation measur es (particularly greenhouse gas emission \\nreductions) immediately. To react to global change only at the same moment as \\nprofound negative impacts occur would be more than negligent. Therefore, policy \\nmakers, private businesses and citizens need to work together to develop adaptation strategies. \\nAs a starting point for the development of adaptation strategies, this study offers \\nmultiple plausible scenarios of global change. The scenarios are based on a range of assumptions about various possible socio-economic developments. They therefore \\nrepresent a first range of options for action. The scenarios contain not only driving \\nforces, but also potential impacts on essential ecosystem services. The scenarios represent the current state-of-knowledge, including the main uncertainties. \\nSocio-economic indicators can be used to characterise the general conditions for \\nadaptation measures. However, in the end adaptation strategies depend on the \\nspecific context. We need adaptation strategies on various scales (European, regional, \\nnational and local) and for various sectors and relevant ecosystem services (e.g. water, agriculture, health, tourism). \\nSustainable management of the human-environment system and its ecosystem \\nservices can reduce vulnerability to global change. In this report, we focus in on a ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='- 21 -  \\n number of specific ecosystem services, since sustainable management naturally \\ndepends on the specific context. To recognise and identify a specific ecosystem service is the first essential step. Then the dynamics of the ecosystem service under the influence of humans and the environment, and in interrelation with other ecosystem \\nservices needs to be examined. In doing so, numerical ecosystem models are useful \\ntools, especially if they capture human management, such as models of forestry, agriculture and terrestrial carbon dynamics. Furthermore, it is important if the \\necosystem service is seen and managed as a private or public good, because this \\nspecifies the interest groups and clarifies policy options. \\nThe development of adaptation strategies cannot and should not be a pure scientific \\nenterprise. Only stakeholders can provide a practical understanding of the economy of specific sectors. Moreover, the decision about suitable adaptation strategies is not only a question of facts and plausible scenarios, but also of values. Conflicts of interests \\nand values are inevitable. They can only be resolved in an equitable dialogue between \\nall actors and stakeholders. \\nThe adaptation strategies illustrated in this study have been developed in a dialogue \\nbetween scientists and stakeholders from private and public sectors. As options for action, they are the starting point for discussing the decision making process. \\n1.4 State-of-the-art in International and National Research \\nA number of developed countries have conducted integrated assessments of \\nvulnerability to climate change on national level. These were in particular United Kingdom (many regions, selected sectors), Norway (all regions), USA (all regions), \\nCanada (all regions) and Portugal (national and regional case studies), as well as, with \\ncertain constraints, Australia and France. To date a similar study of Germany for all regions and sectors does not exist. Generalisations of results from studies conducted in \\ndifferent countries should be drawn with caution, however, a few common features are \\napparent. In particular, it appears that vulnerability to climate change strongly depends on scale, that it is often regionally  very heterogeneous, that uncertainties in \\nfuture regional climate changes often do not allow robust predictions of regional \\nclimate impacts, that only in a few cases possible abrupt climate changes (“climate \\nsurprises”) are considered, that an important prerequisite for the achievement of practical results and recommendations is the integration of scientific analyses with \\nparticipatory approaches, and that climate change is mostly just one of many factors \\nin political decision making.  \\nPractice-oriented climate impact research in Germany is funded by various sources. \\nGermany currently hosts no comprehensive integrated research program on national level, such as the exemplary United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme  (UKCIP). \\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und \\nForschung, BMBF; funding focus areas F75010 and F75099, DEKLIM) is the main \\nsponsor of climate impact research in Germany. It continues to fund a multitude of sectoral and regional, integrated research projects. Major funding domains particularly \\ncover coastal and flood protection, water supply and distribution, as well as forestry. \\nThe German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG), which is \\ntraditionally focused on basic scientific research, so far has established only two \\nfunding areas (Sonderforschungbereiche, SFB) with direct relevance for adaptation to \\nclimate change (SFB 419: http://www.uni-koeln.de/sfb419/, und SFB 433, http://www.sfb607.de/deutsch/sci ence/bedeutung/sfb_forstwirtschaft.html). Since the \\n4\\nth framework programme, the European Commission (DG Research) has funded a \\nnumber of integrated research projects on European level, which contribute results \\nrelevant for Germany (e.g. ACACIA, ATEAM, AVEC, cCASHh, CLAWINE, DINAS-COAST, ECLAT-2, EUROTAS, ENRICH, LTEEF, PRUD ENS, SPRUCE GROWTH, WAKE, WISE). \\nHowever, such projects usually cannot substitute detailed national studies, due to the \\nnecessarily coarser regional spatial resolution. The German federal states also play an important role in funding practice-oriented research, but there are profound \\ndifferences between specific states. Integrated vulnerability studies on federal state \\nlevel have so far been conducted for Bava ria (BayFORKLIM, 1990-1999), Brandenburg \\n(Brandenburg-Studies, 1997 and 2003) an d Baden-Württemberg (KLARA, 2003-2005). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='- 22 -  \\n These studies have applied very different methodologies and obtained different results. \\nFurther regions that have been studied in depth at least partly are the North and Baltic sea coasts, as well as the Island Sylt, the Weser estuary, the watersheds of Elbe, Oder and Danube, the city of Cologne, and the Bornhöveder Lakes. \\nA multitude of natural science-oriented sensitivity studies and climate impact studies \\nfor selected climate-sensitive systems are available for Germany, and are regularly \\npublished in the refereed literature. In contrast to this, results from the few integrated \\nvulnerability assessments and adaptation studies often do not appear in the international refereed literature, but get published only in project reports or in the \\nproceedings of one of Germany’ s 22 geographical societies. \\nIn the face of these scattered research initia tives, the regionally and sectorally patchy \\ncoverage and the different methodologies (as well as barriers in the accessibility of \\nsome research results), it is very difficult to obtain a comprehensive impression of \\nGermany’s vulnerability to climate change, despite of a multitude of separate studies. Also, the comparison of regions that are exposed to very different risks (e.g. storm \\nsurges vs. decline in reliable snow cover for winter tourism) is conceptionally difficult \\nand requires value judgments. A good amount  o f  d a t a  i s  a v a i l a b l e  f o r  t h e  s e c t o r s  \\ncoastal protection (e.g. KRIM, case study Sylt, KLIMU, BALTEX), forestry (e.g. German \\nforest study/GFS), water supply and distribution (e.g. KLIWA, GLOWA-Elbe, GLOWA-\\nDanube, EMTAL), and hazard prevention (e.g. DFNK, DKKV). However, there are major gaps in knowledge concerning other sectors (e.g. agriculture, biodiversity, human health, tourism, energy supply). The recently completed Brandenburg-study identifies \\ndecreasing water availability and increased risk of forest fires as main risks due to \\nclimate change, where the latter can be minimised via a suitable forest conversion programme. The final report of BayFORKLIM identifies little critical danger, except in \\nthe sector flood protection (in spite of a pronounce climate change scenario). Detailed \\nconclusions on regional threats need to be based on an in depth study on the available literature. For the above given reasons, it can however not be expected that such \\nliterature study would yield a general measure of vulnerability or a comprehensive set \\nof sector-specific maps. \\nComparison and integration of available studies are hindered especially by the fact that \\nthey are based on very different climate change scenarios. Oftentimes only a few \\nscenarios are considered, in spite of the impossibility to justify such a selection. The European vulnerability assessment ATEAM is the first to be based on a comprehensive \\nset of internally consistent scenarios of multiple factors of global change (socio-\\neconomic, climatic, land-use, N-deposition). In this way, results from different sectors from this study can be compared. Moreover , through the use of multiple consistent \\nscenarios, uncertainty is treated more comprehensively than in previous studies. Our \\nstudy is therefore based on scenario data from ATEAM (see chapter 2).

ATEAM’s \\nvulnerability concepts and methodology were partly adopted and its results have been \\nused in this study. The European vulnerability assessment was based on a set of consistent, spatially explicit scenarios of global change, a range of ecosystem models, \\nindicators for ecosystem services, a generic index of macro-scale adaptive capacity, as \\nwell as a continuous dialogue with stakeholders (Schröter et al., 2004, Schröter et al., 2005). In the following, a few elements of the ATEAM vulnerability-methodology are \\ndescribed in more depth. \\n2.1 Socio-Economic Scenarios and Emission Scenarios  \\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends a set of future \\nscenarios, which cover the range of uncertainties of driving forces, as well as of \\nemission pathways, without assigning a probability  of occurrence  to any individual \\nscenario (Nakicenovic & Swart, 2000). Through using multiple exposure scenarios, a wide range of possible future developments is covered. Although the current state of \\nknowledge does not allow us to single out any of these scenarios as least or most \\nprobable, the comparative analysis of many scenarios enables us to identify regions, which are vulnerable under most scenarios, and regions, which appear vulnerable only \\nunder one specific scenario. Furthermore, regions will be recognised that do not \\nappear vulnerable under any of the scenarios. Starting from scenarios of socio-economic development, emissions and atmosp heric carbon dioxide concentration, the \\nATEAM assessment was therefore based on a set of internally consistent, spatially \\nexplicit scenarios on a 10’x10’ latitude/longitude grid resolution (ca. 16 x 16 km) of \\nthe main driving forces climate and land-use change for the time slices 2020, 2050, 2080, and the baseline 1990.

Furthermore, the ATEAM provides scenarios of atmospheric nitrogen deposition – however, these include only oxidised, but not reduced nitrogen \\ncompounds, which comprise ca. 50% of total deposition. The nitrogen deposition \\nscenarios are currently developed further within the European project ALARM\\n3, \\nreduced nitrogen compounds will now be added. \\nThe so-called marker scenarios, or IPCC-SRES-Scenarios4 are the starting point of \\nscenario development (Nakicenovic & Swart, 2000). These scenarios are based on narrative descriptions of plausible future worlds (“storylines“) that were developed by \\na large group of experts\\n5 and edited in a long-term open review process6. The \\nstorylines are based on explorations of th e major driving forces, such as population \\ngrowth, economic development and technological change. The SRES-scenarios are \\nstructured in four major families labelled A1, A2, B1 and B2, each of which emphasises \\na different set of social, environmental and economic ideals. These ideals are organised along two axes (see Fig. 2-1). Th e vertical axis distinguishes an economy-\\noriented (A) from a socially and environmentally compliant world (B). The horizontal \\naxis represents the range between global (1) and regional (2) development. For \\nexample, the A1 scenario describes an economically and globally oriented \\ndevelopment. \\n                                              \\n \\n2 ATEAM – Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling (EU Project No. \\nEVK2-2000-00075), www.pi k-potsdam.de/ATEAM. \\n3 ALARM – Assessing Large-scale Environmental Risks with Tested Methods (EU Project \\nNo. GOCE-CT-2003-506675). \\n4 SRES = Special Report on Emission Scenarios.  \\n5 The group comprised of 50 experts from over 18 countries. \\n6 Publicly available on the web from June 1998 to January 1999.

The A1 scenario was further elaborated by assuming different combinations of fuels and technolo gy development to satisfy energy demand. \\nA1f remains dominated by fossil fuels, in A1b a mixture of fossil fuels and renewable \\nenergy sources is used (b stands for “balance d”), in A1t the energy system is based on \\nnew energy-efficient technological developments and renewable energy sources. This differentiation of the A1 scenario was necessary since technological developments in \\nthe energy sector have a profound influence on emission trajectories and eventually \\ngreenhouse gas concentrations, particularly in this world of rapid economic growth. In this study we focussed on the SRES -scenarios A1f, A2, B1 and B2. \\n \\nFig. 2-1: Dimensions and main driving forces of the SRES-Scenarios (see text). \\nAs an example of a socio-economic factor, let us examine population development in \\nthe different SRES-scenarios. In all scenarios except A2, population declines a little \\n(toward the end of the 21\\nst century in the scenarios A1 and B1 to just under 80 \\nmillion, and to ca. 70 million in the B2 scenario). In the A2 scenario, population begins to rise slowly toward the end of the century, after an initial slight decline (Schröter et \\nal., 2004). \\nIn a similar form, the scenarios contain information about the economy, technological \\ndevelopment, energy use etc. Integrated  assessment models are used to gain \\nquantitative scenarios of these factors from narrative descriptions. This study is based on trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions that were quantified using the integrated \\nassessment model IMAGE 2.2 (IMAGE team 2001). Scenario-specific emissions of \\ngreenhouse gases lead to specific atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. In all scenarios, greenhouse gas concentrations increase throughout the 21\\nst century. The \\nsteady incline of greenhouse gas concentrations starts differentiating more distinctly \\nbetween scenarios only from the year 2050 onward. From 2050, the B1 scenario \\nexhibits the weakest incline (to just about 520 ppmv in 2100), followed by B2 (to just about 610 ppmv in 2100). The economy-oriented scenarios lead to distinctly higher \\ngreenhouse gas concentrations, particularly the A1f scenario (ca. 960 ppmv in 2100), \\nwhile the CO\\n2-concentration for the A2 scenarios reaches 870 ppmv by the year 2100. \\n2.2 Climate Scenarios \\nFour state-of the-art climate models (HadCM3, CSIRO2, CGCM2 and PCM) were forced \\nwith trajectories of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, which resulted from \\nthe four emission scenarios. The climate models were chosen from internationally accredited models and according to availability. The 16 alternative climate scenarios \\nrepresent 93% of the range of possible gl obal warming scenarios presented by the \\nIPCC in 2001. The outputs of the climate models are open to public access through the IPDD-data-distribution centre. However, their spatial resolution of 0.5ºx0.5º (ca. \\n50x50 km) is insufficient for the study of many climate-sensitive systems and  \\n \\n \\n   \\n Global RegionalEconomic\\npopulation\\neconomy\\ntechnologyenergy useland useenvironment\\nMain driving forcesB1A1\\nB2A2A1tA1bA1f\\nSocial and \\nenvironmental', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 26}), Document(page_content='- 28 -  \\n particularly of the vulnerability of the human-environment system. For such studies, \\necological and socio-economic processes need to be captured, which cannot adequately be represented at a 0.5ºx0.5º resolution. Therefore, the climate scenarios were downscaled to a resolution of 10’x10’ (ca. 16x16 km; Mitchell et al., 2004). \\nFurthermore, observed climate variability during 1901-2000 was used to produce \\nrealistic variability for the scenarios. The resulting scenarios are known as TYN SC 1.0 and are available to the public. A later version of these scenarios, including a few \\nimprovements is available from the ATEAM-project (Schröter et al., 2004). \\n2.3 Land-Use Scenarios \\nIn parallel to the climate scenarios, a set of land-use scenarios at the same spatial \\nresolution (10’x10’) was developed (Ewert et al., 2004; Kankaanpää & Carter, 2004ab; \\nReginster & Rounsevell, 2005; Rounsevell et al., 2005a; Rounsevell et al., 2005b). The \\nland-use types urban area, cropland, grassl and, bioenergy production (biomass energy \\nsources from agricultural production, such as  e.g. barley and rape seed), forest, as \\nwell as protected and recreational areas were considered. The land-use scenarios are \\nbased on the emissions and socio-econom ic development described in the SRES-\\nscenarios, as well as on the climate scenarios that were developed from those. For this, the socio-economic driving forces were downscaled to Europe, to Germany, and \\nfinally to the regional scale (so-called NUTS2-level, which is approximately the level of \\nadministrative districts). Changes in agricultural land area were calculated considering food supply and demand. For this, scenario specific changes in crop yield were \\naccounted for, depending on climate change , increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, \\nand technological development. Demand for specific land-uses (food production, bioenergy, forestry, settlements) were take n from the integrated assessment model \\nIMAGE and account for socio-economic development outside of Germany and Europe \\n(IMAGE Team, 2001).  \\nTab. 2-1: Priority scenarios used in the ATEAM project. \\n4 climate models  \\n7 Scenarios \\nCGCM2 CSIRO2 HadCM3 PCM \\nA1f   A1f-HadCM3  \\nA2 A2-CGCM2 A2-CSIRO2 A2-HadCM3 A2-PCM \\nB1   B1-HadCM3  4 SRES \\nScenarios \\nB2   B2-HadCM3  \\n \\nThe spatial allocation of land-uses was performed following scenario-specific \\nassumptions about policy development. For this, scenario-specific hierarchies were \\ndeveloped, according to which the competing land-use types were distributed. In this \\nway, the change in relative area over time and space per scenarios and for each 10’x10’ grid cell was determined. The Scenarios were developed by a group of experts \\nand with participation of stakeholders from agriculture, forestry, as well as the nature \\nconservation sector (Rounsevell et al., 2005 ab). The scenarios of forestry development \\nare based on a country-specific analysis of forest policy (Kankaanpää & Carter, 2004b).  \\nDue to budget constraints in ATEAM, seven priority scenarios were chosen for land-use \\nchange scenario development from the total set of 16 climate scenarios : A1f, A2, B1, \\nB2 forced with climate projections from HadCM3, and additionally A2 forced with \\nclimate from the climate models CSIRO2, CGCM2 and PCM (referred to as A1f-HadCM3, A2-HadCM3, B1-HadCM3, B2-Had CM3, A2-CSIRO2, A2-CGCM2, A2-PCM). \\n(see Tab. 2-1). This resulted in a set of consistent scenarios, which contain the \\nuncertainties inherent in emission trajectories, as well as in climate projections. The land-use scenarios are based on the other scenarios (SRES socio-economic, emission, ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 27}), Document(page_content='- 29 -  \\n concentration and climate scenarios). Therefore, to force impact models, such as e.g. \\necosystem models, the land-use scenarios are consistently used in combination with the respective other scenario.  \\n2.4 Ecosystem Models – Quantifica tion of Potential Impacts \\nPotential impacts of global change are changes in the supply of ecosystem services, \\nsuch as yield losses in forestry due to drought and increased fire risk. A range of ecosystem was used to translate scenarios of global changes into potential impacts (see Tab. 2-2). Together with stakeholders from private and public sectors, indicators \\nof ecosystem services were selected that are relevant for the sectors agriculture, \\nforestry, carbon storage and energy, water, nature conservation, and tourism. In particular the ecosystem services agricultural and forestry production, carbon storage \\nin vegetation and soils, river runoff and seasonality, species richness and snow safety \\nwere selected. \\nTab. 2-2: Ecosystem models, which were used to simulate potential impacts, listed \\nby sectors. \\nSector Model Reference \\nAgriculture ROTHC  (Coleman et al., 1997) \\n IMAGE (biofuel demand) (IMAGE team, 2001) \\nForestry GOTILWA+ (Sabaté et al., 2002) \\n EFISCEN (Karjalainen et al., 2003) Carbon storage LPJ (Sitch et al., 2003; Thonicke et al., \\n2001; Venevsky et al., 2002) \\nWater Mac-pdm (Arnell, 1999 modified; Arnell, 2003) Nature conservation Statistical Niche Models - \\nBIOMOD (Thuiller, 2003; Thuiller, 2004) \\nMountain ecosystems RHESsys (Tague & Band, 2004) \\n \\n2.5 Results from Other Studies and Projects \\nBesides ATEAM, a multiple other studies and projects as sources of information on \\nnational and regional scale.

References to the studies and projects that were included can be found in chapter 3 and 4 of this report.  \\n2.6 Survey of Regional Experts \\nGoing beyond the ATEAM project, for this German vulnerability assessment we \\nconducted a survey on the seven climate-sensitive sectors (forestry, agriculture, water management, tourism, nature conservation, health, and transport) with regional experts from the sector-specific functional departments of each federal state.  \\nObjectives of the Survey \\nThe objectives of the survey were  \\na) To estimate the regional and sector-specific significance of potential impacts of \\nglobal change, and \\nb) To appraise the present degree of adaptati on and suitable adaptive measures to \\nthese impacts. \\nThe estimation of the significance of potential impacts of climate change aims primarily \\nat evidence for vulnerability assessment in specific sectors and regions, since climate \\nimpact research offers only little sector- and region-specific knowledge for such \\nevaluation. Furthermore, through direct involvement of regional experts and their risk appraisal we included their concerns of protection and based the vulnerability \\nassessment on a broader set of values.  \\nGaps in current knowledge further triggered the need to assess the present degree of ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 28}), Document(page_content='- 30 -  \\n adaptation and suitable adaptation measures. In Germany the process of adaptation to \\nthe impacts of climate change is just beginning. Specific sectors and regions already face the challenges. Therefore the aim of the interviews of regional experts was on the \\none hand to identify existing initiatives an d collect their experiences, and on the other \\nhand to appraise the degree of implementation of measures that are suitable  to adapt \\nto climate change, even if they were motivated  by other intentions (e.g. conversion to \\nmixed forests in forestry).  \\nThe Respondents \\nWe exclusively questioned representatives from sector-specific functional departments of the federal states, e.g. from the state fo restry administration or the ministries of \\nhealth. Owing to budget constraints, only one representative per federal state and \\nsector was interviewed. \\nNaturally, our assessment through this survey is influenced by the subjective views of \\nthe respondent. Moreover, only the viewpoin ts of federal state administrations were \\nrepresented. The perspectives of associations, non-governmental organisations, businesses or citizens are not captured. Finally, from some federal states only few \\nquestionnaires were returned. \\nThe Questionnaires \\nIn the forestry sector, we conducted pilot-interviews via telephone with experts from \\nthe forestry administration of the federal states, to test the interviewing method. In \\nthe remaining climate-sensitive sectors we later conducted a slightly improved survey \\nvia written questionnaires, due to budget constraints.  \\nPer sector and federal state we developed a specific questionnaire. All questionnaires \\nwere divided into two main parts: (a) Rating of risks and opportunities, and (b) appraisal of adaptation measures. \\nThe rating of risks and opportunities focussed on climate change and specific potential \\nelements\\n7 and sector-specific impacts8 of climate change \\n• in the specific sector of the respondent, \\n• in specific environmental zones9 within the federal state of the respondent (see \\nFig. 2-2), \\n• in different time periods (recently: 1990 to present; in the short-term: present to \\n2010; in the medium-term: 2010 to 2020; in the long-term: 2020 to 2050), \\n• on a qualitative scale (very negative – negative – slightly negative – neither \\npositive nor negative – slightly po sitive – positive – very positive)10. \\n                                               \\n7 Elements of climate change are for example the increasing average annual \\ntemperature and the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events. Respondents from \\nall sectors contemplated the same elements (e.g. biodiversity, agriculture), so that \\npositive evaluations sometimes occurred in one sector, while the same element was thought of as negative in another sector.  \\n8 Sector-specific impacts of climate change are for example in the biodiversity sector \\nchanges in the phenology (bud break, bloom etc.) of plants. In each sector, different sector-specific impacts were evaluated. \\n9 Environmental zones were not defined by state borders, but were determined by \\nbiological and geographical factors. Respondents from several states may have \\nevaluated the same environmental zone, bu t different state-specific parts of the \\nenvironmental zone were considered. \\n10 Pilot-interviews in the forestry sector on the evaluation of the significance of \\nelements and impacts of climate change in the specific states were conducted without differentiation by time peri od or environmental zone.

Therefore the respondent sees this impact as a large \\nrisk. \\nWe asked the respondents to consider (a) if they thought a specific climatic \\ndevelopment would impact environmental zones in their federal state, and how strong the climatic phenomenon would be according to their view, (b) how positive or negative this development would impact their specific sector within the environmental \\nzone during a specific period of time, and (c) how developed the adaptation and \\nadaptive capacity of their sector is or will be concerning this climatic development in their federal state, so that risks could be avoided and opportunities exploited. \\nBesides enquiring about standardised elements and impacts of climate change, \\nrespondents were asked about further opport unities and risks they envisage for their \\nsector in their federal state.  \\nFurthermore we investigated the level of information about climate change and its \\nimpact, for example by asking if the respondents had access to analyses of the climatic \\ndevelopment of the recent years or decades in their federal state, or to projections of future climatic development (scenarios). Knowing the level of information is useful to get an impression of the reliability of  the judgements revealed by the survey. \\nFehler! Es ist nicht möglich, durch die Bearbeitung von Feldfunktionen \\nObjekte zu erstellen.  \\nFig. 2-2: Environmental zones that were evaluated with regard to potential impacts \\nof climate change. \\nIn the appraisal of adaptation , we were interested in the respondents’ impressions \\n• of the effectiveness of various sector-specific measures, to respond to potential \\nimpacts of climate change in the specific federal state (i.e. to mitigate risks, and \\ncapitalize on opportunities); possible answers were “effective” or “not effective”, \\n• of the present degree of implementation of measures within the specific federal \\nstate on a qualitative scale (not discussed – currently considered – planned – \\npartially implemented – implemented), \\n• of the reasons for implementation or failed implementation of measures (for \\nclimate change or other reasons), \\n• of the obstacles for a successful implementation of the measure (financial, \\norganisational, legislative, lacking knowledge, others obstacles), in case the \\nmeasure is not yet fully implemented, and \\n• of how complicated it would be to implement the measure with regard to the \\nobstacles, on a qualitative scale (not complicated – slightly complicated – \\ncomplicated – very complicated). \\nWe explicitly asked the respondents to answ er these questions even if no adaptation \\nmeasures to the impacts of climate change have yet been implemented in their federal state, since often measures that are suitable for climate change adaptation have \\nalready been implemented for other reasons (e.g. conversion to mixed forests in \\nforestry). \\nIn addition to the standardised questions on adaptation measures, the questionnaire \\nenquires about further measures that would be suitable in the view of the respondent to adapt to the impacts of climate change in their sector and federal state.  \\nFurthermore we explore the degree to which adaptation to climate change has been ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='- 32 -  \\n discussed in the specific functional department, in order to identify such measures and \\ninitiatives that are aimed specifically at climate change adaptation. For example, we enquire about the existence of practical programmes (i.e. projects that are not \\nprimarily research related) on adaptation to the impacts of climate change. The \\npresent significance of the topic “adaptation to climate change” relative to other topics \\ndiscussed in the specific administration is assessed on a qualitative scale (unimportant – slightly important – important – very important). \\nThe uncertainty of climate change impacts is a particular challenge in the field of \\nadaptation. The assessment of climate change and its potential impacts always \\ncontains a certain uncertainty. Absolutely certain predictions about the future climatic \\ndevelopment do not exist. Therefore the ques tionnaire enquires about how the specific \\nadministration deals with this uncertainty, and how this uncertainty is taken into account in the planning of adaptation measures. \\n2.7 Stakeholder-Workshop  \\nIn Germany, the public and political discourse on necessary responses to climate \\nchange has so far been focussed on measures for emission reduction. Such measures are necessary, because they reduce the cause of anthropogenic climate change. \\nHowever, it is just as necessary to adapt to the impacts of climate change, a fact that \\nonly recently has drawn increased attention in  Germany. Public awareness, as well as \\nawareness of decision makers from the private and public sector and from the \\nadministration for this issue has to be increased. \\nThe survey within the climate-sensitive sectors forestry, agriculture, water \\nmanagement, tourism, nature conservation, health, and transport that was described \\nin the previous section addressed only representatives of the functional departments of the federal states. The Federal Environm ental Agency, supported by the Potsdam \\nInstitute of Climate Impact Research (PIK) therefore conducted a stakeholder-\\nworkshop with representatives from free enterprises, policy, administration, and associations (including nature conservation groups), to gain additional insights also from the private sector. \\nAims of the Workshop \\nThe aims of the stakeholder-workshop were: \\n• To provide information and a forum for discussion of research results on climate \\nimpacts and adaptation in Germany, and to raise the awareness of relevant actors \\nabout the climate problem and adaptation needs, \\n• To initiate a dialogue between actors in order to improve the assessment of \\nvulnerability, \\n• To check recommendations for adaptati on measures with relevant actors, \\n• To communicate uncertainties, discuss decision-making under uncertainty and the \\nuse of research results with actors, \\n• Public relations, including accompanying press releases and press conferences \\n(impacts of climate change, the necessity of mitigation and adaptation), \\n• To kick-off a network of actors working on adaptation to climate impacts in \\nGermany through expansion of the existing network within administrations; \\nparticularly clarification of the role of such a network of actors, including an analysis of demands and requirements: Identification of needs for further \\ninformation and guidance, \\n• Introduction of the aims, tasks and products of the Centre of Competence for \\nClimate Impacts at the Federal Environmental Agency; including further \\ncompetences. \\nThe workshop program designed to fulfil  these aims can be found in Box 2-1. \\nBox 2-1 – Program of the Stakeholder-Workshop ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 31}), Document(page_content='- 33 -  \\n 9:00 h  Welcome; Introduction to the Aims of the Workshops  \\nDr. H.

In the context of global change this \\nstudy is particularly concerned with climate change11, but also with the increase in \\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and with land use change. We distinguish to kinds of vulnerability: \\n• Vulnerability without  further adaptation (current vulnerability, business-as-usual \\nscenario) – Future risk of harm of a human-environment system due to global \\nchange (particularly climate change) under the assumption that its degree of adaptation (e.g. flood protection) will not change in future. \\n• Vulnerability with further adaptation  (improved-business scenario) – Future risk of \\nharm of a human-environment system due to global change (particularly climate \\nchange) under the assumption that present ad aptive capacity will be fully used to \\nimprove its degree of adaptation in future. \\nBy comparing vulnerability without  further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario) and \\nvulnerability with further adaptation (improved-business scenario) we obtain an \\nimpression of the risk of damages due to global change (particularly climate change) \\nwith and without further measures of adaptation. \\nBoth kinds of vulnerability are assessed on a qualitative scale with three steps (low – \\nmoderate – high vulnerability). We deliber ately avoided a quantitative vulnerability \\nindex; since such an index would give the impression of a level of precision that is \\nneither realistic concerning the potential impacts of global change, nor concerning the adaptation to these impacts. \\nTo assess vulnerability we integrated results on scenarios of potential impacts of global \\nchange in Germany (see 2.1 to 2.4), findings from other studies and projects (see 2.5) and results from regional expert surveys (see 2.6). This was done through a dialogue \\nbetween the participating researchers and with  consideration of the regional experts’ \\nassessment of risks and vulnerabilities. It was initially planned to also consider the views of representatives from free enterprises, non-governmental organisations, \\nadministration and policy, which participated in the stakeholder-workshop (see \\nchapters 2.7 and 5). However, the participants’ interviews prior to the workshop revealed that their knowledge of the topic was not sufficient for an estimation of \\nvulnerability.  \\nWe present vulnerability assessments of the seven climate-sensitive sectors (forestry, \\nagriculture, water management, tourism, na ture conservation, health, and transport) \\n(see chapters 4 and 6.1.2). Furthermore, chapter 6.1.1 presents a comparative vulnerability assessment of various regions and environmental zones in Germany. \\nFinally, we wish to stress that our qualitative vulnerability assessment is a preliminary \\nand highly aggregated statement that mainly serves to summarise risks in the different regions and sectors in Germany. More concrete and practice-oriented \\ninformation on potential impacts of global change, and climate change respectively can \\n                                              \\n \\n11 Since this report is primarily concerned with climate change, we often speak of \\n“vulnerability to climate change“ instead of “vulnerability to global change“.

Future studies \\nshould include stakeholders and affected groups of people in the process of vulnerability assessment even more than this study was able to, in order to produce more robust estimates of vulnerability. \\n2.9 References \\nArnell, N.W.

The annual average temperatur e increased by ca. 0.8 to 1.0ºC between \\n1900 and 2000 (Rapp, 2000; DWD, 2004). However, this warming did not occur linearly (Fig. 3-1). A strong warming up to 1911 was followed by a heterogeneous \\nperiod. The 1940s were exceptionally warm. After a cooling trend up to the 1970s we \\nnow observe a continuous and rapid temperature increase that still continues today. There is strong regional variation. In the last decade (1990s), the temperature rise in \\nsouthern and south-western Germany was exceptionally strong.  \\nSingle value Mean 1961-90 Linear trendºC\\nSingle value Mean 1961-90 Linear trendºC\\n \\nFig 3-1: Annual average mean daily te mperature in Germany 1901-2003 (DWD, \\n2004). \\nTab. 3-1: Overview of climatic trends in Germany (Jonas et al., 2005). \\nClimatic element  Spring Summer Autumn Winter Year \\nTemperature, \\n1901 - 2000 + 0.8 °C + 1.0 °C + 1.1 °C + 0.8 °C + 1.0 °C \\nTemperature, \\n1981 – 2000 + 1.3 °C + 0.7 °C - 0.1 °C + 2.3 °C + 1.1 °C \\nPrecipitation, \\n1901 – 2000 + 13 % - 3 % + 9 % + 19 % + 9 % \\nPrecipitation, \\n1971 - 2000 + 13 % + 4 % + 14 % + 34 % + 16 % \\n \\nObservations on seasonal trends in the warm ing depend on period in time and method. \\nDuring the last twenty years a trend toward stronger temperature increase in winter ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 36}), Document(page_content='- 38 -  \\n than in summer has been observed. For ex ample, the temperature increase in the \\nwinter months in Germany during the period between 1981 and 2000 was 2.3ºC, while in the summer months it was merely 0.7ºC (Tab. 3-1). This is often attributed to a higher frequency of zonal weather conditions in winter that bring mild oceanic weather \\nto Germany (Günther, 2004).  \\nPrecipitation \\nPrecipitation in Germany is characterised by strong regional and seasonal variations. In the long term, neither the average values nor the seasonal or regional distribution \\nshow significant trends (Fig. 3-2). During the last 100 years there has been a small trend towards increased winter precipitation, but this trend is not significant (Müller-Westermeier, 2001). In the last 30 years, however, there was indeed a definite \\nincrease in winter precipitation. Summer precipitation in contrast showed little change \\n(Tab. 3-1). Again this trend can probably be attributed to an increased frequency of zonal circulation patterns in winter that bring plenty of precipitation with them. \\nChanges in the duration of snow cover are also relevant. Since 1950, a decrease by \\n30-40% in the duration of snow cover has been observed in altitudes below 300m in \\nBavaria and Baden-Württemberg. In the medium altitudes (300-800m) the decrease \\nwas 10-20%. In higher altitudes over 800m only small decreases and in places even increases were observed, due to increased winter precipitation and sufficiently low temperatures for snowfall (Günther, 2004). \\nSingle valueMean 1961-90Linear trend\\n Single valueMean 1961-90Linear trend\\n \\nFig. 3-2: Annual precipitation in Germany 1901–2003 (DWD, 2004). \\nClimate Extremes \\nThere is only partial evidence for an increase in climate extremes, such as heat waves, \\nextreme rainfalls and storms.  \\nExtreme heat events, such as heat days (T > 30ºC) or heat waves (intervals of more \\nthan three days during which the maximum daily temperature lies above a certain high threshold, relative to the specific temperature standard of the weather station) exhibit \\na definite trend. For example, the probability of occurrence of heat days in the months \\nof July and August has risen over the last one hundred, and especially markedly during \\nthe last twenty years at almost all weather stations in Germany. The probability of \\noccurrence of an extremely hot summer such as in the year 2003 increased in the \\ncourse of the 20\\nth century by more than a factor of 20. Nevertheless, 2003 was an ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 37}), Document(page_content='- 39 -  \\n extraordinary year even for today’s standards. It was the hottest year in Germany \\nsince the beginning of weather recording. With summer temperatures of 3.4ºC above the 30-year mean, 2003 also exhibited the strongest summer anomaly (Schönwiese et \\nal. 2003). Moreover, the year 2003 was exceptionally dry. The continuing long-term \\ndry phase between February and August was extraordinary. \\nThe intensity and frequency of occurrence of  extreme rainfall events have increased \\nespecially during the last forty years of the 20\\nth century. In general, this trend is more \\npronounced in the winter than in the summer (Grieser & Beck, 2002). \\nThe intensity and frequency of occurrence of squalls have also been investigated. \\nHowever, at present no statistically significant trend can be found. There is a tendency of increased probability of occurrence of extremely high daily wind speed maxima (Bft > 8) during winter (with the exception of coastal regions), and decreased occurrence \\nof such maxima in summer (with the exception of southern Germany) (Jonas et al., \\n2005). \\n3.1.2  Scenarios of Future Climate Change \\nData Sources and Methods \\nClimate change is s global phenomenon driv en by global factors. Therefore, climate \\nmodelling needs to be performed by global  climate models. Mostly, these are coupled \\nocean-atmosphere models, which calculate processes within the climate system in grid cells of a resolution of several 100km. These models are called General Circulation \\nModels (GCMs).  \\nGCMs produce scenarios for assessments at global scale. For assessments on national \\nscale these model outputs are too coarse. There are various methods for downscaling \\nto obtain information at a higher resolu tion. On the one hand there are regional \\nclimate models, such as the model REMO from Hamburg, Germany (Jacob & Podzun, 1997), which simulate atmospheric processes at a higher resolution (10-50km) for a \\nspecific study area and use GCM results only for the edges of the study area. On the \\nother hand, there are a number of statistical methods that use historical high-resolution information on climate, atmospheric conditions and weather to downscale \\nthe coarse GCM results to finer resolutions. Both methods have advantages and \\ndisadvantages. Regional climate models can capture complex weather phenomena (extremes, winds). However, they are di fficult to calibrate, sometimes produce \\nunrealistic results due to their complexity and sensitivity, and require very extensive \\ncomputation. Statistical methods are comparatively robust and less extensive with regard to computation. However, they will  partly reproduce errors and uncertainties \\nfrom the GCMs, and they often produce only  average values of climatic parameters. \\nMost statistical methods cannot capture extreme events. \\nA number of projections of future climate change are available for Germany and \\nspecific regions. Among others, these are results from the model REMO, and from \\nstatistical methods by Werner and Gerstengarbe (Werner & Gerstengarbe, 1997), and by Enke (Enke, 2003) \\nThis study was mainly based on results from the ATEAM project (see chapter 2). In \\nthis project a statistical method (pattern scaling; Mitchell et al. 2004) was used to downscale results from four GCMs (also used in the IPCC report: HadCM3, PCM, \\nCSIRO2, CGCM2) driven by four differen t emission scenarios (SRES-scenarios, see \\nchapter 2.1) to a grid cell resolution of ca. 16x16 km. The ATEAM climate scenarios cover Europe. ATEAM-results are available as long-term averages for various climate \\nvariables for the time slices 2020 (1991-2020), 2050 (2021-2050) and 2080 (2051-\\n2080). Seven priority scenarios were chosen out of the full set of 16 climate scenarios (see Tab 2-1 in chapter 2).  \\nTemperature \\nAll seven ATEAM-scenarios show a distinct warming of Germany (Fig. 3-3). The warming of the long-term average annual temperature in these scenarios ranges from ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='- 40 -  \\n +1.6 to +3.8ºC by the year 2080. \\nRegionally, many scenarios show a particularly strong warming in the south-west, and \\npartly also in the far east of Germany (Fig. 3-8 in the Annex). The scenarios show \\ndifferences in seasonality. The trend of stronger warming in winter, which was \\nobserved in historical data, is not maintained in the future scenarios. \\nThe results depend strongly on the choice of emission scenario, as a comparison of \\ntemperature scenarios calculated by the climate model HadCM3 shows (A1, A2, B1, B2, red lines in Fig. 3-3). While temperatur e increases “only” by 2.1ºC until the year \\n2080 under the two “environment-oriented” scenarios B1 and B2, the “economy-\\noriented” scenario A1 shows an increase of up to 3.8ºC until 2080 under the assumption of continued use of fossil fuels.  \\nComparing the results of the different climate models (HadCM3, PCM, CSIRO2, \\nCGCM2, see chapter 2.2) for the A2 scenario, the range of warming by the year 2080 is 1.6 to 2.9ºC. One of the reasons for this large range is the relatively small degree of \\nwarming simulated by the model PCM (green line in Fig. 3-3). This model is \\ncharacterized by particularly low climate sensitivity (warming resulting from a doubling in the atmospheric CO\\n2-concentration) (Meehl et al., 2005), and therefore produces \\nthe low end of the range. \\nChanges in Average Annual Temperature [°C]\\n012345\\n1990 2020 2050 2080∆T [°C]\\n1.6 - 3.8 °C\\n(∆2.2 °C)\\n1.6 - 2.9 °C\\n(∆1.3 °C)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Changes  \\nby 2080\\n2.1 - 3.8 °C\\n(∆1.7 °C)4 SRES\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2Changes in Average Annual Temperature [°C]\\n012345\\n1990 2020 2050 2080∆T [°C]\\n1.6 - 3.8 °C\\n(∆2.2 °C)\\n1.6 - 2.9 °C\\n(∆1.3 °C)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Changes  \\nby 2080\\n2.1 - 3.8 °C\\n(∆1.7 °C)4 SRES\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2\\n \\nFig. 3-3: ATEAM-scenarios of long-t erm annual average temperature change \\ncompared to 1990 in Germany up to 2080. \\nThis comparison stresses two sources of uncertainty in climate scenarios. On the one \\nhand, uncertainty in climate projections results from the range of possible greenhouse \\ngas emission trajectories. However, this also indicates a range of choices and future \\noptions, since the reduction of greenhouse ga s emissions could significantly reduce the \\nexpected warming. On the other hand, di fferent climate models produce different \\nresults for one and the same emission scenario. This kind of uncertainty results from \\nthe difficulty to model the global climate system and the many non-linear processes \\nand feedbacks it contains for a time period of several decades. This uncertainty cannot be entirely removed, even if great advances have been achieved in the recent years. \\nRegarding temperature, we conclude that at least on long time scales the uncertainty \\nwithin climate modelling is smaller than the variation brought about by different \\nemission trajectories. \\nPrecipitation \\nRegarding annual precipitation all scenarios show only very little changes that mostly \\nlie below 10% until 2080.

All seven scenarios show an increase in winter \\nprecipitation (Fig. 3-4), while summer precipitation decreases in most scenarios (Fig. 3-5). This is in accordance with the observed trend of a shift of precipitation into winter. This shift is more marked in the scenarios with high greenhouse gas \\nconcentrations (A1, A2), than in the “e nvironment-oriented” scenarios (B1, B2). \\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080∆P [%]\\n6.6 - 29.6 %\\n(∆23.0%)\\n6.6 - 21.5 %\\n(∆14.9%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n10.0 - 29.6 %\\n(∆19.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2Change in Winter Precipitation [%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080∆P [%]\\n6.6 - 29.6 %\\n(∆23.0%)\\n6.6 - 21.5 %\\n(∆14.9%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n10.0 - 29.6 %\\n(∆19.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2Change in Winter Precipitation [%]\\n \\nFig. 3-4: Change in winter precipitation compared to 1990 for seven ATEAM \\nscenarios in Germany up to 2080. \\n∆P [%]\\n-33.3 -4 . 9 %\\n(∆38.2%)\\n-16.6 -9 . 6  %\\n(∆26.2%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-33.3 --12.7 %\\n(∆20.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)Change in Summer Precipitation [%]\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A21990 2020 2050 2080-50 -25 02550∆P [%]\\n-33.3 -4 . 9 %\\n(∆38.2%)\\n-16.6 -9 . 6  %\\n(∆26.2%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-33.3 --12.7 %\\n(∆20.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)Change in Summer Precipitation [%]\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A21990 2020 2050 2080-50 -25 02550\\n \\nFig. 3-5: Change in summer precipitation compared to 1990 for seven ATEAM \\nscenarios in Germany up to 2080. \\nRegionally the most distinct increase of winter precipitation is projected for southern \\nGermany, at least in the scenarios based on HadCM3 (Fig. 3-9 in the Annex). \\nDecreasing summer precipitation in these scenarios is concentrated on Southwest \\nGermany (Rhineland) and the central parts of Eastern Germany (Fig. 3-10 in the Annex).

', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 40}), Document(page_content='- 42 -  \\n Results from other Climate Models \\nIn the following we summarise exemplary results from other projects.  \\nFor the Elbe-watershed, scenarios by Wern er and Gerstengarbe are available (in \\nWechsung et al., 2004). These show a mo derate warming of 1.4ºC by 2055 and a \\npartly distinct decrease in precipitation of up to 200mm, particularly in summer. \\nRidges of low mountain ranges are exceptions to this trend. \\nThe project KLIWA produced several climate scenarios of the time period 2021-2050 \\nfor Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg (Weber, 2004). This project compared results from the regional climate model REMO (Jacob & Podzun, 1997) with the two statistical methods by Enke (Enke, 2003) and by Werner and Gerstengarbe (Werner & \\nGerstengarbe, 1997). Depending on the model, a temperature increase of 1.2 –1.7ºC \\nin summer was found, and of 1.0 – 2.0ºC in winter. Changes in precipitation by 2050 range from +5% to +13% in summer, and in winter from 0% to +34%. The general \\ntrends of warming and increased winter precipitation are corroborated. However, \\nuncertainties also become apparent, particularly in the regional precipitation trends. \\nEnke (Thüringer Landesanstalt für Umwelt und Geologie, 2004) produced climate \\nscenarios of the time period 2021-2050 for Thuringia. These estimate a warming by 1.5ºC. Winter precipitation is calculated to increase by 23%, while summer precipitation is estimated to decrease by 8%. \\nSimilar scenarios are available for other federal states, for example for Saxony (Enke, \\n2003), Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia (both using the method by Werner \\nand Gerstengarbe), or are currently developed. By order of the Federal Environmental \\nAgency, climate scenarios at high resolution are currently prepared for the whole of Germany using the regional model REMO. These scenarios are planned to build a \\nconsistent database for future research on climate change and its impacts. \\n3.2 Land-Use Change \\nBesides climate change, land-use change ha s a pronounced effect on ecosystems and \\nthe services they provide. Therefore, in th e ATEAM project, land-use change scenarios \\nwere developed in addition to climate chan ge scenarios, and their feedbacks to the \\nclimate scenarios were considered. \\nThe most significant land-use change Germ any will experience is the abandonment of \\nagricultural areas. As a consequence of cutbacks of subsidies, the eastward enlargement of the EU, liberalisation of the ma rket and falling world prices agricultural \\nareas will be given up, especially on poorer soils. The extent of this abandonment will \\ndepend on socio-economic conditions. \\nThis is also the case in the ATEAM-scenarios – land-use change is mostly dependant on \\nthe SRES storyline. Agricultural land is pr ojected to decrease by approximately 12% in \\nthe environment-oriented B- scenarios (B1, B2), and by up to 25% in the economy-oriented scenarios (Fig. 3-6). The development of forest area shows a different trend. \\nParticularly in the environment-oriented scenarios wood-demand is projected to \\nincrease owing to increasing demand for renewable primary products. This leads to afforestation and an increase in forested area by approximately 10% (Fig. 3-6). In \\ncontrast, forest area decreases slightly in the economy-oriented fossil fuel based A-\\nscenarios (by approximately 5%).

On the \\nother hand, abandoned areas offer an opportunity as production area for renewable \\nprimary products (and therefore sources of income for agriculture). Moreover, such areas could be used for nature conservation. Agriculture could also undergo \\nextensification, including a higher proportion of organic farming. \\n3.3 Net Carbon Balance of the Terrestrial Biosphere \\nEcosystems absorb carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Large amounts of this \\ncarbon are released again, for example through autotrophic respiration and \\ndecomposition of soil organic matter. The balance between carbon uptake and carbon \\nrelease is referred to as “net carbon balance”. Ecosystems with a positive net carbon balance are sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Ecosystems with a negative net carbon balance are sinks of carbon. Carbon sinks can contribute to the reduction of \\natmospheric greenhouse gas concentration thro ugh the uptake of carbon dioxide, and \\ncan therefore contribute to climate protection. \\nThe ATEAM project has produces scenarios of  the net carbon balance up to the year \\n2080 (Fig. 3-7). According to these results, the net carbon balance of Germany’s terrestrial biosphere is neutral (neither sink nor source) in the baseline year 1990. All \\nscenarios then show increasing sink strength  up to the year 2020. This trend is due to \\nan increased uptake of carbon dioxide by the vegetation owing to enhanced plant growth under CO\\n2-fertilisation and moderate warming.  \\nChange in Net Carb on Balance [g m-2a-1] \\n-18.8 --7.3%\\n(∆11.5%)\\n-13.8 --7.3%\\n(∆6.5%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-18.8 --9.0 %\\n(∆9.8%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2-25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0\\n1990 2020 2050 2080Change in Net Carb on Balance [g m-2a-1] \\n-18.8 --7.3%\\n(∆11.5%)\\n-13.8 --7.3%\\n(∆6.5%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-18.8 --9.0 %\\n(∆9.8%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2-25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0\\n1990 2020 2050 2080\\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 42}), Document(page_content='- 44 -  \\n Fig 3-7: Change in net carbon balance in comparison to 1990, up to the year 2080 \\nin Germany, based on all seven ATEAM scenari os.

Additionally, the probability of extreme \\nrainfall events is increased particularly in winter and the duration of snow cover is \\nprojected to decrease.  \\nPresumably mostly in the months of winter and spring the risk of flooding increases \\nacross Germany. The Alpine region and hi ghly built-up regions without sufficient \\nretention areas are particularly at risks. It is as yet unclear to what extent the risk of \\nsummer floods will increase.  \\nEspecially the central and eastern areas of Germany will suffer from a decreased \\nsupply of water in the summer months. The risk of drought increases and is \\naccompanied by constraints in agriculture, forestry, energy supply and navigation, and \\npossibly also in drinking water supply. \\nA reduction of groundwater recharge is a further potential negative impact of climate \\nchange. Hitherto, constraints in drinking water supply due to climate change have not \\nbeen expected, despite an increasing eutrophication in many areas. \\nSo far, the water sector is little adapted to the impacts of climate change. In the \\nplanning of flood protection the impacts of climate change find little consideration in \\nmost federal states. Therefore, we presently consider the vulnerability of the water \\nsector as “high” across Germany (business-as -usual scenario, see chapter 2.8). As yet, \\nwater supply and distribution is not prepared for water shortages in summer. If no \\nadaptation measures are implemented, the vu lnerability of impacted regions (eastern \\nGermany) will be “high”. In the remaining areas, vulnerability to water shortages is \\n“moderate”. \\nIn general, the water sector should be able to adapt to future climate impacts, since a \\nfull range of sufficient adaptation options are available, even if their implementation is \\nmostly considered to be complicated. Saving water and rebuilding natural rivers are \\nconsidered to be most effective in adapting to a multitude of uncertain impacts of \\nclimate change. However, adaptation measures in water supply and distribution can \\npresumably not be implemented without special support (particularly financial \\nresources). If the necessary adaptation measures are implemented, a reduction to \\n“low” vulnerability of the water sector to climate change can be expected (improved-\\nbusiness scenario, see chapter 2.8).

The supply of water in sufficient quantities and quality is the direct \\nprerequisite for various provisioning ecosystem services (see chapter 1.3). Humans rely on water as essential nutritional source , as well as for sanitary purposes. Water is \\nused by industry of the production of goods and services. Other ecosystem services \\ndependant indirectly on water. Rivers, lakes and oceans host plants and animals that are a worthwhile source of nutrition for humans (Lozan et al., 2005). All other sectors covered in this report (forestry, agriculture, water management, tourism, \\nbiodiversity/nature conservation, health, and transport) also depend directly or \\nindirectly on the supply of water in sufficient quantity and quality. \\nBesides the long-term availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality, society is \\nin need of keeping the risk through hydrol ogical extreme events as small as possible \\n(regulating ecosystem service). A deficiency of water leads to droughts that have \\nnegative impacts on nature (aquatic ecosystems and wetlands) and society \\n(agriculture, forestry, navigation, industry, energy generation, drinking water supply). Too much water leads to flood events that can cause high human and physical damages.  \\nThe water cycle is part of the climatic system, and therefore closely intertwined with \\nclimatic factors. Terrestrial ecosystems receive water mostly through precipitation. A \\nlarge part of the water evaporates directly (evaporation) or is returned to the \\natmosphere via plants (transpiration). The sum of these processes, the so-called evapotranspiration, depends of climatic factors such as temperature, radiation, vapour \\npressure, and wind. Furthermore, the structure and composition of land cover plays a \\nmajor role. \\nThe part of precipitation that does not ev aporate or transpire runs off above- or \\nbelowground, feeding the surface waters and gr ound water resources. The size of this \\nrunoff is an important indicator for water surplus and the amount of water that is available to the human-environment system. Furthermore, short term “stores” (e.g. \\nthe soil) are recharged or emptied. \\nBesides runoff, the amount of groundwater resources, the geological conditions for \\ngroundwater recharge, and the connection to surface waters are important for water \\navailability. The availability of water to nature and society also strongly depends on regional water demand. If tis demand is high, water availability can be limited. \\n4.1.3  Baseline Situation: Water Su pply and Distribution in \\nGermany \\nWater in Germany \\nGermany is a country rich in water; 2.2% of its surface area is covered by water. The \\nwater surface is comprised of eleven large rivers (Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Weser, Ems, \\nWarnow/Peene, Elder, Schiel/Trave, Oder, Rh ône, Maas; categorised according to the \\nWater Framework Directive of the European Commission (EG-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie, \\nEG-WRRL)) and their receiving streams. Natu ral lakes contribute approximately 0.85% \\nof the surface area. Furthermore, Germany has 291 dams. Approximately 11.7% of the surface area are designated to drinking water protection and underlie restrictions of use to protect existing water resources. \\nWater Supply \\nThe supply of water depends strongly on the climatic water balance. Within Germany, the climatic water balance, defined as the difference between precipitation and \\npotential evapotranspiration, is highly heterogeneous on large and small scales (Fig. \\n4.1-1). While significantly more precipitation falls on the Alpine region than is lost through evapotranspiration (positive water balance), the climatic water balance is \\nnegative in large parts of eastern Germany. The largest deficits in climatic water \\nbalance occur in the eastern foreland of the lower mountain range Harz and in the ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 48}), Document(page_content='- 50 -  \\n fault of the river Oder, where the lowest amounts of precipitations within Germany fall. \\nIn the summer months large parts of Germany exhibit a negative balance. If the weather is low in precipitation, a negative balance can occur in all months except November and December. Regions with an unfavourable water balance have \\npotentially low water supply and therefore are more at risk to suffer from drought and \\naridity than other regions. \\nClimatic Water Balance in mm a-1\\nClimatic Water Balance in mm a-1\\n \\nFig. 4.1-1: Climatic water balance of Germany (BMU, 2003). \\nWater Demand \\nGerman water demand is regionally and locally heterogeneous. It depends on the \\ndegree of colonisation and industrialisation, as well as on seasonally varying water supply and demand. The largest amount of water, approximately 56%, is used as cooling water by power authorities. Mining and industry together use approximately \\n18%. Approximately 13% of water use goes to public water supply. Agriculture and \\nforestry use less than 1% of the water (Fig. 4.1-2; Federal Statistical Office, 2005). \\nBetween 1990 and 1998, the amount of water used by industry and heat power plants \\ndeclined sharply. For example, particularly in eastern Germany the daily water demand decreased from 142 L day\\n-1capita-1 (1990) to 93 L day-1capita-1 (2000) (BGW, 2001). \\nThis was achieved by water saving technologies and investments in more effective \\nwater supply and distribution facilities. Increased prices of water and wastewater treatment furthermore changed consumption behaviour of inhabitants, methods of production and the elimination of water losses in conduit. \\nMomentarily, Germany’s water resources are judged as sufficient, since only \\napproximately 24% of available resources are used (UBA, 2001). However, even today \\nwater shortages occur regularly in regions with unfavourable water balance \\n(particularly Brandenburg). In particular, this region lacks water to keep the water level of rivers constant and to flood the pits remaining after strip mining.

The hot and dry years in the 1990s, an d particularly the year 2003 have shown \\nthat Germany can be hit by low water and drought, in spite of lying in the temperate \\nclimate zone. In Germany this exceptionally long dry and hot phase has led amongst \\nother things to increased risk of forest fires and losses in the agricultural sector. There were constraints in inland navigation, as well as in heat, water and nuclear power plants. The reinsurance company Munich Re estimates the costs of the heat wave of \\n2003 in Germany at more than 1.2 billion € (Eisenreich, 2005). However, the supply of \\ndrinking water was not threatened during 2003 (Demuth, 2004). \\nRisk of Flood Events \\nThe occurrence of flood events is determined  by the characteristics of precipitation \\n(intensity, volume, duration), initial conditions (soil moisture), conditions of infiltration, geomorphology, event size, as well as by temporal and spatial scales of the precipitation (Niehoff, 2002).  \\nExtreme rainfall events in the past have regularly caused severe flood catastrophes, \\naccompanied by physical damages and losse s of lives (EEA, 2001). Flood events are a \\nfrequently occurring danger in Germany and should be taken seriously, as the \\nhundred-year-flood at the Rhine in the winter  of 1993/1994 and 199 5, at the Oder in \\nthe summer of 1997, and the thousand-year-flood at the Danube, Elbe and their \\ntributaries in August 2002 have shown. The Elbe flood alone caused 20 casualties and \\na physical damage of approximately 9 bi llion € (BFG, 2002). Flood events in large \\nwatersheds are mostly caused by long-lasting, advective rainfall events (land rain), with or without contributions of snow melting. On the other hand, convective extreme \\nrainfall events (local extreme rainfall even ts) often cause small-scale floods with high \\ndamage potential. Such small-scale floods cause approximately half of all flood damages in Germany (Bronstert, 1996). \\nA plausible cause of the observed increase in the frequency of flood events (e.g. in \\nsouthwest Germany; Caspary, 2004) is, among others, the statistically evident \\nincreasing frequency of extreme rainfall events (Grieser & Beck, 2002; Schönwiese, \\n2005). However, this increase can only be substantiated for the winter months. Therefore, it is believed that the probabilit y of winter floods, such as e.g. the Rhine \\nfloods, is already increased. Summer floods, such as e.g. the floods at the Oder 1997 ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 50}), Document(page_content='- 52 -  \\n and the Elbe 2002, are often caused by specific general weather situation (e.g. the so-\\ncalled “Vb weather condition”). Again, a number of studies substantiate at least the increased frequency of such weather conditions (Fricke & Kaminski, 2202).  \\nBesides climatic conditions, a number of other factors are important for flood risk, such \\nas decreased regional water retention capacity due to river regulation, the construction of barrages, the loss of floodplains and wetl ands, and the increased sealing of surface \\nareas. For example, the river Rhine has already lost four-fifth of its natural floodplains. \\nSimilarly, at the river Elbe only 15% of the natural floodplains remain (IKSE, 1996; \\nBMU, 2002). Moreover, agriculture causes more frequent floods by the usage of heavy \\nmachinery on arable fields and the consequent condensation of soils, which hampers \\nthe infiltration capacity. At present, the influence of these anthropogenic factors is \\nmore pronounced than climate change.  \\nOther Factors \\nBesides water extraction for industry, households and agriculture, the draining of strip mines for brown coal is an important factor for the water balance. This is done in the Rhineland, the Niederlausitz, and in the re gion between Helmstedt and Leipzig/Halle. \\nThe draining of mines causes a gradual drying up of wetlands, sometimes the running \\ndry of creeks and rivers, and a decrease in the water available for public water supply. Moreover, the water demand for the flooding of pits remaining after strip mining can threaten regional water supply (e.g. at the Spree).  \\nSociety depends not only on sufficient water quantities but also on sufficient water \\nquality. In Germany, agriculture hampers the water quality of groundwater and \\nreceiving streams through the use of fertilisers and pesticides on arable land. These \\nare leached to the groundwater or are transported to the surface waters through erosion, leading to eutrophication of surface waters and oceans. Charging groundwater \\nwith nutrients, such as e.g. nitrate, causes a profound loss in the usability of the \\naquifer as drinking water resource and can negatively impact groundwater biology. Moreover, water resources are burdened with heavy metals, organic chemicals, and pesticides.  \\n4.1.4  Impacts of Climate Change – Trends and Projections \\nWater Supply and the Risk of Droughts \\nThe future impacts of climate change on th e water sector are highly dependent on how \\nthe regional and seasonal distribution of pr ecipitation develops, since precipitation and \\nthe water sector are tightly linked. However, the projection of regional precipitation by \\nclimate models comes with large uncertainties. Depending on the model, the scenarios \\nmay differ sharply from each other. Therefore, statements about water demand also come with large uncertainties. The expected temperature increase mainly causes an \\nincrease in evapotranspiration and therefore potentially decreases the climatic water \\nbalance. Moreover, indirect consequences su ch as e.g. changes in winter snow cover \\nand increased water use through elongated vegetation period also affect the water \\nbalance.  \\nWe analysed scenarios of mean annual runoff, “drought runoff” (Q90), and summer \\nrunoff across Germany from the ATEAM project (see chapter 2; Schröter et al., 2004). \\nHere we understand runoff as the diffe rence between precipitation and actual \\nevapotranspiration (vegetation-dependent transpiration). The amount of runoff is therefore comparable with the climatic water balance.  \\nThe annual runoff is tightly linked to annual precipitation. Due to the small changes in \\nannual precipitation under most scenarios, changes in annual runoff in Germany also \\nlie below 10% in all seven climate scenarios studied here (Fig. 4.1-3). The regional \\ndistribution is however different (Fig. 4.1-9 in the Annex). In the North and Northeast of Germany there appears to be a trend of de creasing runoff, while there is a trend of \\nslightly increasing runoff in the South, particularly in the scenarios based on the \\nclimate model HadCM3. However, the results based on the climate model CSIRO2 \\nexhibit the exact opposite trend.

Q90 (drought runoff) is the annual runoff that is exceeded in nine years out of ten. That is, the runoff in one out of ten years lies under the Q90 value. \\nTherefore this value is an indicator of the runoff to be expected in arid years.

There are strong \\nregional differences, with local decreases of over 50% in some parts of Northern and Eastern Germany (Fig. 4.1-10 in the Annex). However, again different climate models \\nproduce different regional patterns.  \\nResults for summer runoff (runoff during the months June, July and August; Fig. 4.1-\\n5) show an even more differentiated pattern. Water availability is distinctly reduced in \\nsummer according to five of the seven climate scenarios, due to the shift of precipitation from summer to winter that is projected by many climate models, and ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 52}), Document(page_content='- 54 -  \\n owing to the temperature increase, which increases evapotranspiration, and \\nparticularly transpiration (through plants) (change by 2080 in comparison to 1990 of –43% to +5%). This reduction in water availability is projected across all parts of Germany (Fig. 4.1-11 in the Annex).  \\nThe degree to which a region is hit by changes in runoff depends strongly on the size \\nof the change and on the initial situation. Especially regions that presently have an \\nunfavourable water balance and low runoff, such  as e.g. the central regions of Eastern \\nGermany (Fig. 4.1-1), can be strongly impacted by climate change. In these regions, the shift of precipitation from summer to winter leads to further decreases in summer \\nrunoff, when the situation has already been di fficult in arid years, and causes further \\nwater shortages. Even if the results vary between climate models, there is considerable evidence that climate change will increase the risk of arid periods and droughts.  \\n∆Q [%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-43.0 -5 . 5  %\\n(∆48.5%)\\n-27.6 -5 . 5  %\\n(∆12.1%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-43.0 --24.2 %\\n(∆18.8%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2Change in Summer  Runoff [%]∆Q [%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-43.0 -5 . 5  %\\n(∆48.5%)\\n-27.6 -5 . 5  %\\n(∆12.1%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-43.0 --24.2 %\\n(∆18.8%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2Change in Summer  Runoff [%]\\n \\nFig. 4.1-5: Relative change in summer runoff (June – August) up to 2080 compared \\nto 1990 for seven ATEAM scenarios. \\nLow water and droughts have severe consequences for almost all sectors considered in \\nthis study. Agriculture, forestry, energy and drinking water providers, as well as public bodies will have to prepare for recurring arid periods in Germany. Moreover, wetlands and aquatic ecosystems are threatened. In general, there is a clear need for a well-\\nbalanced adaptation strategy, which includes storage, limitations in water demand, \\nand alternative sources of water. \\nRisk of Flood Events \\nA number of scientists expect a generally incr eased risk of extreme rainfall events and \\nfloods as a consequence of climate change (Palmer & Räisänen, 2002; Milly et al., 2002). Climate change is also expected to impact flood development in Germany, due \\nto changes in precipitation characteristics (Bronstert, 1996). This concerns not only the \\nabsolute amount of precipitation, but also intensity, duration and frequency of rainfall events. Regional trends in precipitatio n development are ambiguous (Eisenreich, \\n2005), however, there is considerable evidence for a decrease in summer precipitation \\nand an increase in winter and spring precipitation, leading to an increase in the \\nprobability of winter floods. \\nDecreased snowmelt owing to temperature-induced decreases in snow accumulation \\ncould, however, reduce the flood peaks (Eisenreich, 2005). Furthermore, decreased frequency of the freezing up of rivers due to temperature increase reduces the \\nprobability of floods triggered by ice accumulation, such as have been primarily \\nobserved at the Elbe river in the past (Bronstert, 1996). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 53}), Document(page_content='- 55 -  \\n Integrated Results for Specific Watersheds \\nRunoff at the river Rhine is expected to shift to early spring, owing to the shift of \\nprecipitation from summer to winter (Middlekoop & Kwadijk, 2001). The ATEAM \\nscenarios also project this shift (Fig. 4.1-6). The HadCM3-A2 scenario shows a shift of monthly peak flows of the Rhine (at the water gauge Kaub) from May/June (1990) to \\nMarch (scenario for 2050). \\nDetailed case studies for three study regions in the Rhine watershed from the project \\nLAHoR (Bardossy et al., 2003) estimate a decrease in precipitation in November and \\nDecember, accompanied by an increase in precipitation during the months of March and April by 2080. Based on these finding, the probability of the typical “Christmas \\nfloods” at the Rhine will potentially decrease. On the other hand, the probability of \\nflood events in spring increases. This is caused by the increase in precipitation in early \\nspring, as well as by the simultaneous snowmelt in the Alps and higher low mountain ranges. \\nThese results are in accordance with findings of the research group KLIWA, which also \\nproject a potential increase in flood risk du ring winter and early spring for the Rhine \\n(Krahe et al., 2004). \\nMean Monthly Runoff along the Rhine at the Water Gauge Kaub\\nkm3month-1\\n2050 (HadCM3-A2)1990Mean Monthly Runoff along the Rhine at the Water Gauge Kaub\\nkm3month-1\\n2050 (HadCM3-A2)1990\\n \\nFig. 4.1-6: Mean monthly runoff along the river Rhine at Kaub 1990 and 2050, \\nclimate scenario calculated by climate model HadCM3 with A2 emissions (ATEAM \\nresult).  \\nThe research group KLIWA also offers results for the watershed of the upper Main \\n(Barth et al., 2004) and the Neckar (Ger linger, 2004). These results corroborate the \\ntrend of shifting runoff to the months February, March, April, as well as a potential \\nincrease in flood risk during this time.  \\nSome studies project decreasing water availability in the Elbe watershed. In this region \\na decrease in runoff by approximately 40% (Wechsung, 2004) and of groundwater \\nrecharge of next to 50% (Hattermann et al., 2004) is expected, on the assumption of decreasing annual precipitation up to 2050. \\nFurther Impacts of Climate Change \\nChanges in river runoff impact water levels and water quality of lakes and canals directly (Eisenreich, 2005). Particularly in shallow and warm water bodies, the growth of zoo- and phytoplankton and therefore the ri sk of eutrophication can increase, due to \\ndeclining water levels, increasing warming and increasing suspension of sediment. This \\ndevelopment impacts not only drinking water provision, but also sectors such as tourism. For example, decreasing summer precipitation and declining inflow from the \\nheadwater threaten the tourism region Spreewald (forested region around the river \\nSpree near Berlin) (Dietrich, 2004).

In general no shortages in drinking water are expected, despite decreasing amounts of groundwater storage in North and West Germany, as \\nwell as parts of East Germany (BMU, 2001).  \\n4.1.5  Impacts of Climate Change – Assessment by Regional \\nExperts \\nAs described in chapter 2.6, we conducted expert surveys in various climate-sensitive \\nsectors, including water supply and distribution. Sector-specific assessments of potential elements and impacts of climate change are available for different \\nenvironmental zones (see chapter 2.6) from seven federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, \\nHamburg, Berlin, Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg. Positive ratings are regarded as acknowledgments of opportunities, negative ratings as \\nacknowledgments of risks. The results of th e survey are depicted in Fig. 4.1-7. The \\nassessment, which is discussed in the followin g, must be seen as preliminary, since \\nonly one expert per federal state was approa ched and the return of the questionnaires \\nfrom the 16 federal states was scarce. On the other hand, more than half of the \\nrespondents base their assessment on studies of past and future climate development and its impacts in their federal state.  \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nThe respondents rated the outcome of climate change for the water sector in recent times (1990 to today) mainly as “neither positive nor negative”, although some responded “slightly negative” (responses were averaged over all environmental zones \\nand federal states). In the short (today to 2010), medium (2010 to 2020) and long \\n(2020 to 2050) term climate changes is judged on average as “slightly negative”, with increases in the number of “negative” ratings for the more distant future. No \\nrespondent used the rating “very negative ”, neither for any environmental zones nor \\nfor a specific time period. Also, there are no positive ratings of climate change. Therefore the outcome of climate change for the German water sector is seen uniformly as negative. \\nRisk Assessment \\nRespondents thought of increased extreme rain fall events as the greatest risk in the \\nshort term, with an average rating of this potential element of climate change  as \\n“negative”. In the medium and long term, this risk is seen as increasingly negative. \\nIncreasing summer temperature, more heat days and heat waves, the decrease in annual precipitation\\n12 and larger variation of precipitation between years were rated as \\n“slightly negative” in the short term. Increasing average annual temperature, \\nincreasing winter temperature and fewer frost days were seen as neutral in the short \\nterm, but were rated as risks in the medium to long term. In general, negative rating increased with time. \\n                                              \\n \\n12 According to the present state of knowledge increases and decreases in annual \\nprecipitation are possible, depending on th e region. Therefore, both developments \\nwere offered to the respondents for rating.

Already in the recent past (1990 to today), these impacts were on average rated as “slightly \\nnegative”. For the future, the ratings mostly are “negative”, and in some \\nenvironmental zones “very negative”. Decr eased runoff, the consequently decreased \\nwater availability, the larger variations in water availability, and the changed \\ngroundwater tables were rated as “slightly negative” in the short term. Changes in \\nquality and quantity of drinking and industrial water were on average rated neutrally to “slightly negative”, with large differences in the ratings between environmental zones particularly for drinking water (ranging from “very negative” to neutral). \\nOpportunity Assessment \\nRespondents rated only one element of clim ate change on average as an opportunity: \\nthe possible increase in annual precipitation. In the short, medium and long term this \\ntrend is on average seen as neutral to “slightly positive”. However, the differences \\nbetween specific ratings increase over time, and tend to be drawn toward the negative range. \\nFurther Impacts \\nFurthermore, we asked about additional possible impacts of climate change in the water sector. Respondents listed impacts on the limnology of lakes, changes in temperatures of flowing and standing water bodies (each depending of the range of \\ntemperature increase), and the expansion of wetlands. \\n4.1.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nIn the water sector, adaptation to future changes in climate plays a central role, \\nbecause water management is concerned not only with extreme events like floods and \\nlow water, but also with keeping a steady balance between water supply and demand. \\nAll sectors depend directly or indirectly on sufficient water availability and some have very specific demands concerning water quality. Adaptation measures therefore have \\nto be well-balanced and should be grounded in a national and international framework. \\nFlood protection has been a central in Germany since centuries. The probable increase \\nin flood frequency and the possible increase in runoff need to be taken into account in \\nthe adaptation to future climate conditions. To do this, present measures of flood protection need to be adapted. This includes sufficient flood retention on flood plains, a regulation that limits construction and other development on the likely flood plains, \\nprecaution in constructions, behavioural foresight, hazard protection and technical \\nflood protection. There needs to be a stronger discussion of potential impacts of climate change by river catchment’s commissions (UBA, 2001). \\nThe likely occurrence of periods of low water and aridity call for sustainable land use \\nmanagement, which secures the retentio n of water in the landscape. Such \\nimprovement of the landscape water balance has additional advantages for flood \\nprotection. As a further measure of precaution the infrastructure should be built to store sufficient amounts of water in dams, and to open the possibility of transporting water through long-distance pipelines. Suitable water saving measures should be \\nimplemented in industry, agriculture, fo restry and private households, to avoid \\nrestrictions of usage. Agriculture and forestry will have to prepare for water shortages by adapted cultivation techniques and modern water-saving irrigation devices. Water \\nuse in industry can also be decreased further through improved production processes. \\nSurface waters should be managed nature-o riented, and if necessary reconstructed \\n(e.g. through the creation of flood plains or the revival of bayous), to sustain the \\nnatural capacity of ecosystems. The sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to impacts of climate change decreases with improved wate r quality and ecological state of surface \\nwaters, as is already called for in the European Water Framework Directive. \\nFurther adaptation strategies to expected  climate change in Germany are financial ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 57}), Document(page_content='- 59 -  \\n safeguarding through insurances against flood damage and drought-related yield \\nlosses, as well as the creation of reserv e funds for damage reparation and future \\nadaptation measures. \\n4.1.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nin Adaptation – Assessme nt by Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the expert survey (method described in chapter 2.6) on \\nmeasures that are suitable for climate change adaptation from the following eight \\nfederal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Berlin, Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse, Saarland, and Baden-Württemberg. The follow ing results of the survey must be seen \\nas very preliminary assessment of the measur es that are suitable to adapt the German \\nwater sector to climate change, since only one expert per federal state was approached and the return of the questionnaires from the federal states was scarce. \\nIn the survey, different dimensions of the adaptation measures were evaluated; the \\neffectiveness of the measure to mitigate the risks introduced in section 4.1.5, alternatively to capitalize on the opportuni ties of climate change (see Tab. 4-1), and \\nthe present degree of implementation of the adaptation measure (see Fig. 4.1-8). \\nMeasures of Flood Protection \\nAlmost all respondents rate the first six measures listed in Tab. 4-1 as effective to respond to a potentially increased risk of flood due to climate change: natural flood \\nretention, precautionary land use, precautionary construction planning, precautionary behaviour, risk prevention, and technical flood protection. Only a few respondents expect effects of these measures on other sectors – with the exception of \\nprecautionary land use, which respondents thought of having wide-ranging effects. \\nRegarding the degree of implementation of the six measures of flood protection (see \\nFig. 4.1-8), most measures were rated as already “partially implemented”, but \\nprecautionary construction planning was only rated as “planned”, and technical flood protection as nearly “implemented”. However, there are great differences between \\nfederal states. The degree of implementation usually ranged from “currently \\nconsidered” to “implemented”. These differences are partially explained by differences in exposure to flood risk. For example, low ratings of the degree of implementation of \\nmeasures of flood protection are often found in Schleswig-Holstein, while high ratings \\nare found in Hesse, Saxony, and Saarland. The reasons respondents named for \\nimplementing measures of flood protection were mostly protection against floods and reduction of the damage potential. Only one respondent named climate change as one \\nof the reasons for the implementation of some of these measures.

Organisational obstacles  were seen mostly in precautionary land use, but also \\nin natural flood retention, precautionary behaviour and risk prevention. Legislative \\nobstacles  were seen as hurdles only for natural flood retention, precautionary land use, \\nand technical flood protection, lacking knowledge  only for precautionary construction \\nplanning, precautionary behaviour, and technical flood protection (“lack of \\nfundamental planning”). In addition to this, respondents identified conflicts of use and lacking readiness to turnover land area as obstacles for natural flood retention and \\nprecautionary land use. Given these obstacles, respondents on average rated most \\nmeasures of flood protection as “complicated”. Precautionary land use is rated as “very complicated” and precautionary behaviour as “slightly complicated”.

The n-values give the number of \\nquestionnaires each box-plot is based on. For further explanation of the graphical representation see Fig. 4.1-7. \\nSaving Water and Improving Water Quality \\nRespondents thought saving water would have a wide range of positive effects with \\nregard to potential impacts of climate change (see Tab. 4-1). Most respondents \\nthought saving water would be an effective measure with regard to changing groundwater tables. They attributed a lesser range of positive effects for improving \\nwater quality. Most respondents rated this me asure as effective with regard to changes \\nin quality/quantity of drinking and industrial water. \\nThe degree of implementation was rated on  average over eight federal states as \\nalready “partly implemented” for water saving, and as nearly “implemented” for improving water quality (see Fig. 4.1-8). The variation between federal states with regard to rating the degree of implementation of saving water was very high, while the \\ndegree of implementation for improving water quality was rated uniformly high. \\nAmong other things, the respondents named high water demand, resource protection, and the legal obligation through EU-directives as reasons to implement measures to \\nsave water and improve water quality. No re spondent identified climate change as a \\nfurther reason to implement these measures. \\nAgain, the obstacles to implement the measures were identified as mostly financial. As \\nadditional hurdles for saving water respondents named the current ample water supply, low water prices, and the low motivation of citizens. The improvement of water quality was said to be hindered by resistance in industry and politics.

Most respondents rated this measure as effective flood protection. Restrictions of \\nwater and water body use were seen as less broadly effective. Those measures were mostly estimated to be effective concerning changes in the quality/quantity of industrial water. \\nNature-oriented reconstruction of rivers wa s on average rated as already “partially \\nimplemented”, while restrictions of use were  on average “not discussed” (Fig. 4.1-8). \\nFor both measures, the degree of implementation varies only slightly between federal \\nstates. Among other things, flood protection and nature conservations were named as \\ndecisive reasons for the implementation of nature-oriented reconstruction of rivers. Presently sufficient supply of water, the lack of demand for restrictions of use, and \\npresently decreased trends of usage were identified as reasons for not discussing \\nrestrictions of use as an adaptation measure in most federal states. Climate change played no role in the implementation of the measures. \\nAn overwhelming proportion of respondents see financial obstacles as a hurdle in \\nrealising nature-oriented reconstruction of  rivers. The vast demand of area, the \\nexisting dense development, the high maintenance costs, and the lack of wider recognition of the problem were identified as further obstacles. With regard to these \\nobstacles, respondents on average rated the implementation of nature-oriented \\nreconstruction of rivers as “very complicat ed”. No responses were given concerning \\nobstacles or complexity of implementation of restrictions of water and water body use, \\nsince this measure was not seen as necessary most respondents.  \\nMeasures integrating several risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nRespondents rated insurance against damages through climate change and the \\ncreation of reserve funds for future adaptation measures and damage reparation payments respectively as effective concerning flood protection (see Tab. 4-1).  \\nOnly three of eight respondents were able to comment on the implementation of such \\nmeasures (see Fig. 4.1-8). However, they agreed that measures of this kind are “not \\ndiscussed” in their federal states – such measures were not believed to fall into the \\nresponsibility of the administration and no  funds were available for them. Obviously \\nrespondents understood the question about insurances and reserve funds in relation to their administration. A higher level of implementation would undoubtedly be found if \\nthe existence of insurances and reserve funds for citizens and businesses were taken \\ninto account. \\nFurther Measures \\nThe survey also enquired about further measures in the water sector that would be suitable to mitigate the risks and capitalize on the opportunities of climate change. The respondents listed the following measures, some of which are particular forms of the previously discussed measures: Securing ample groundwater balance through water \\nsupply planning (ensuring supply), management of water supply and distribution in \\nsettlements, creation of integrated wate r supply systems, expansion of water \\nconservation areas to secure drinking water supplies, minimisation of nutrient \\ndeposition, and collaboration of flood warning stations across borders. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Water Departments \\nOnly three out of eight respondents from functional departments of federal states that are responsible for water supply and distribution reported that adaptation to climate \\nchange is a subject discussed in their administration. The following concrete projects and practical programmes for the adaptation to climate change were named: “Control \\nTS” in Saxony (determination of target levels for damming, point of contact: LTV \\nSaxony), the project “INKLIM 2012” in Hesse, and the project “KLIWA” in Baden-\\nWürttemberg, in which Bavaria also takes part (focuses so far on adaptation to floods ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 61}), Document(page_content='- 63 -  \\n and low water). It is not clear whether further projects exist in those federal states \\nthat did not return the questionnaire. Two respondents said the current significance of the topic of adaptation was “important”, relative to other topics in their administration; four rated the current significance as “slightly important”, and one respondent rated it \\nas “unimportant”. The topic is currently not seen as “very important” in any of the \\nadministrations. Hence, within the functional departments of most federal states that were included in the survey climate change currently is of little concern.  \\nAdaptation in the Water Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nThe following can be concluded from the results of our survey13: Water saving and \\nnature-oriented reconstruction of rivers are thought to have a broad potential to mitigate various potential impacts and capitalize on opportunities of climate change. \\nThere was no potential impact for which no respondent could envisage a suitable \\nadaptation measure. However, it is striking  that few respondents identified suitable \\nmeasures to meet the risk of reduced water supply. Also, the rating of effectiveness of \\ndifferent adaptation measur es differs strongly between federal states, which may \\npartly reflect varying conditions.  \\nMost measures that are suitable to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the water \\nsector were on average rated as already “p artially implemented”. However, there are \\nvast differences between federal states. Fu rthermore, the minority of measures was \\nrated as already “implemented”, and there is considerable doubt if the existing and \\nplanned measures are sufficient to prepare the water sector for the changes expected \\ndue to climate change. According to the respondents, climate change was usually not among the reasons to implement a specific measure, and the issue of climate change \\nadaptation is only discussed in very few functional departments that are responsible \\nfor the water sector. We therefore conclude that impacts of climate change were not at all, or only marginally considered in the planning of adaptation measures, and that \\nwater supply and distribution in most federal states is not yet prepared for climate \\nchange.  \\nRespondents mostly named financial restrictions as obstacles for the implementation of \\nadaptation measures. Most measures were rated as “complicated” to implement. The \\nimplementation of precautionary land use and nature-oriented reconstruction of rivers (a measure with a broad range of positive effects) were even rated as “very \\ncomplicated”. \\nTherefore, the adaptation to climate chan ge of water supply and distribution in \\nGermany can rely on existing climatic knowledge and can be based on many existing \\nor planned measures. However, so far planning in the water sector has only scarcely considered climate change and is currently probably not prepared for its impacts. The \\nextent of necessary changes in existing ad aptation measures to adequately address \\nclimate change depends on the specifics of each case.  \\nIn general, the water sector should have the capacity to prepare for climate change in \\nfuture. A range of suitable adaptation option s is available, even if they are mostly \\nrated as complicated. However, the adaptive capacity with regard to decreasing water supply seems to be limited – few respondents identify suitable adaptation measures to \\nthis impact, the implementation of which was furthermore rated as “complicated” or \\n“very complicated”. \\nFederal states should use the opportuni ty to exchange their experience and \\nknowledge, since the degree of implementation  of adaptation measures and the state \\nof present discussion on adaptation to climate change was very different between some federal states. \\n                                              \\n \\n13 On measures integrating several risks, i.e. insurances and reserve funds, we cannot \\ndraw any conclusions due to the lack of survey results.

The expected increase \\nin climate variability can lead to increased yield variability and hampers adaptation \\nthrough choice of suitable crop varieties.  However, moderate temperature increase \\nand sufficient water supply would increase the yield potential of many crop types. \\nThe agriculture sector may possibly profit from the impacts of climate change, \\nparticularly in regions that presently are too cool or too wet for agricultural use (e.g. in \\nNorthern Germany). Worrisome developments are the expected decrease in water \\nsupply, owing to decreasing summer precipitation, especially in regions that already \\nsuffer from unfavourable water balances under present conditions (particularly \\nBrandenburg); the increase in climate variability (variations from year to year), which \\nincreases the probability of yield losses and hampers adaptation (across Germany); \\nthe increase in weather extremes; as well as a long term temperature increase beyond \\nthe optimum of many cultivated plants (particularly in South-western Germany).  \\nCurrently German agriculture is only partly adapted to the impacts of climate change. \\nIn most federal states climate change does not seem to be considered in present \\nplanning, and measures that would also be suitable to adapt to climate change are \\nmostly not yet fully implemented. However, agriculture can adapt relatively quickly to \\nchanging climate and weather conditions, and has done so again and again in the past. \\nConsequently, we rate the vulnerability of ag riculture to climate change without further \\nspecific adaptation measures as “moderate”  (business-as-usual-scenario, see chapter \\n2.8). Only in the Eastern German regions that are prone to drought and often have \\npoor soils we rate current vulnerability as “high”. \\nHowever, agriculture should have a high capacity to realise measures that specifically \\naddress climate change ; many diverse and uncomplicated adaptation options are \\navailable. Especially the use of new cultivars and new, adapted cultivation methods \\nthat maintain soil fertility and save water are promising to address a wide range of \\nuncertain impacts of climate change. The cultivation of new crop types and adapted \\nirrigation measures are also rated as effective. However, the cultivation of new crop \\ntypes requires additional knowledge, and th e implementation of adapted irrigation \\ntechniques relies on financial support. Agricultural adaptive capacity will further \\ndepend on economic pressures. In this regard, smaller farms and farms in the less-\\nfavourable areas in Eastern Germany need special support. If the adaptation measures \\nare implemented, the vulnerability of the ag ricultural sector to climate change might \\nbe lessened to “low” (improved-business-scenario, see chapter 2.8).  \\n4.2.2  Agriculture and Climate \\nAgriculture secures the direct supply of food and raw materials to society, and \\ncontributes to maintaining a cultural landscape through landscape conservation. Therefore, agriculture strongly affects provisioning and cultural ecosystem services. In \\nGermany, the surface area that is used for agricultural is greater than for any other \\nland use. Consequently, agriculture influences important factors in a landscape and a diverse set of ecosystem functions. For example, the water balance of a landscape is \\nshaped by irrigation and drainage for agriculture and by the water use through \\nagricultural crops. The agricultural use of nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides impacts \\nwater quality. Species diversity is fundamentally determined by the creation, alteration, fragmentation and destruction of habitats, as well as by the maintenance or \\nloss of old crop species. Finally, agriculture influences the appearance of a landscape \\nand can add to the recreational value of a region. \\nAgriculture is tightly linked to climate and weather conditions. Climatic conditions \\nlargely determine the range of possible crop types and the potential yield of specific \\ncrops. Unfolding weather conditions determine variations in the timing of sowing and \\nharvest, as well as in crop yield. Extreme weather events, such as hail or extreme ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 67}), Document(page_content='- 69 -  \\n rainfall events, as well as drought or heat, can harm arable culture and diminish \\nyields. \\nIn the following we give a general overview of the influence of climate factors on plant \\ngrowth and plant development. \\nTemperature \\nIn general, temperature influences plant phenology (the timing of growth and developmental stages) and essential metabolic processes.  \\nRising temperatures lead to an earlier onset of phonological stages and to en \\nelongation of the vegetation period. Pere nnial crops, which continue growing after \\nreaching maturity (sugar-beet, grassland), and plants with long maturity stages (some \\nmaize cultivars, millet) will profit from this. On the other hand, many cereals show a shortened phase of grain-growth by up to  10% per 1ºC warming, due to accelerated \\ngrowth. This can lead to reduced yields (Weigel, 2004; van Ojen & Ewert, 1999). \\nIncreasing temperatures can also negatively impact the yield of winter grain, which needs certain minimum temperatures in winter for its development (vernalisation). \\nFurthermore, and early onset of the growing season bears the risk of damages through \\nlate frosts. \\nIn general, increasing temperatures increase photosynthesis and other metabolic \\nprocesses, until a crop type specific temperature optimum is reached. Thermophilic crops that have not reached their optimum under current conditions (e.g. maize) can therefore bring higher yields under mode rate warming. Moreover, higher winter \\ntemperatures decrease the risk of frost damages. However, when the optimum is \\nsurpasses, yields of all crop types decrease. Extreme temperatures can harm plants permanently. \\nCarbon Dioxide – CO 2 \\nCarbon dioxide is an important nutrient for plant photosynthesis. For so-called C3-plants, which comprise most of the German cultivated crop plants, the CO\\n2-\\nconcentration of the air is suboptimal and a limiting growth factor. In C 3-plants, an \\nincrease in atmospheric CO 2-concentration therefore increases the rate of \\nphotosynthesis and increases yields (“CO 2-fertilisation effect”; Pinter et al., 1996; \\nKimball et al., 1993). Field experiments showed an increase in wheat yield by up to \\n28% following a doubling of CO 2-concentration (Downing et al., 2000). In Germany \\nfield experiments showed increases by 8-14% for winter barley, sugar beet, and winter wheat (Manderscheid et al., 2003a; Manderscheid et al., 2003b). It is not yet clear if \\nthis increased yield would be sustained in the long term or if there will be a certain \\n“acclimatisation effect”. For C\\n4-plants (e.g. maize, millet) hardly any increase in yield \\nis found, since these plants use CO 2 more efficiently and experience optimal CO 2-\\nsupply already under present conditions. \\nAnother important aspect of increased atmospheric CO 2-concentration is the decrease \\nin water use per unit biomass produced (improved water use efficiency). Further \\neffects of increased CO 2-concentration are increased carbohydrate content of leaves \\nand fruit, along with lower protein content, as well as an increased allocation of carbon to the root system. In food and fodder production, the decreased protein-content of \\nagricultural products is seen as deterioration in quality (e.g. impaired baking \\ncharacteristics in wheat). \\nWater \\nWater is another important factor in photosynthesis and other metabolic processes. \\nDuring CO 2-uptake the plant loses water through transpiration. The amount of this \\ntranspiration depends on the rate of photosynthesis, temperature, and other climatic factors, such as vapour pressure and wind speed. The transpiring water has a cooling \\neffect and protects the plant from excessive heat. Water stress occurs if less water is \\navailable than the plant needs. The plant closes its stomata and the rate of photosynthesis is strongly reduced. Persistent undersupply with water therefore leads ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 68}), Document(page_content='- 70 -  \\n to yield losses. Extreme aridity leads to permanent damages to fine roots and other \\nplant parts. On the other hand, too much water can damage the plant through oxygen deficiency at the roots. \\nInteraction of Temperature, CO 2, and Water \\nThe interplay between the above-mentioned factors determines how crops will react to climate change. To a certain degree, increased CO\\n2-concentration potentially increases \\nyields; increasing temperatures have positi ve and negative effect s. Sufficient water \\nsupply is a decisive factor. If there is enough water, most crops will tend to profit from \\nclimate change. If water is limiting, decreases in yield must be expected (Olesen & Bindi, 2002). \\nAgriculture and Climate Protection \\nAgriculture is a potential source of greenhouse gases, and therefore contributes to climate change, through methane (CH\\n4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions, as well as \\ncarbon dioxide emissions from organic soils. At present, German agriculture \\ncontributes 8.7% to German greenhouse gas emissions (UBA, 2005). This estimate \\ndoes not include carbon dioxide emissions through mineralization of soil carbon, for example from drained fens, which have so far not been quantified. On the other hand, agriculture could contribute to climate protection through the cultivation of renewable \\nprimary resources. \\n4.2.3  Baseline situation: Agriculture in Germany \\nFollowing France and Italy, Germany is the third larges producer of agricultural goods \\nin the European Union. In 2004, approximately 372 400 farms operated in Germany. \\nIn 2004, an estimated number of 1.27 milli on workers were employed full- or part-\\ntime in German agriculture (Federal Government, 2005). The contribution of agriculture to gross national product is, however, only approximately 1% (Federal \\nStatistical Office, 2005b). \\nIn Germany, 53% of the surface area is used for agriculture. Of this land, 29% are \\ngrassland and 69% are cropland. The main products produced on croplands are wheat \\nfor bread making, barley for fodder and industrial use, as well as other fodder crops (clover, lupine etc.) (Fig. 4.2-1). Four percent of the arable area is under organic \\nfarming (Federal Statistical Office, 2005a). The proportion of arable land used to grow \\nrenewable primary products was approximately 6% in 2004, and has doubled since 1998 (Federal Government, 2005). \\nOther forms of cultivation 2% Wheat 18% \\nBarley 12%\\nGrassland 29%\\nArable fallow 5%\\nFodder plants 10%Oilseeds 8%Maize 3%\\nLegumes 1% Other cereals 4% \\nTubers 4%Rye 4%Other forms of cultivation 2% Wheat 18% Wheat 18% \\nBarley 12%Barley 12%\\nGrassland 29%Grassland 29%\\nArable fallow 5%Arable fallow 5%\\nFodder plants 10%Fodder plants 10%Oilseeds 8%Oilseeds 8%Maize 3%Maize 3%\\nLegumes 1% Legumes 1% Other cereals 4% Other cereals 4% \\nTubers 4%Tubers 4%Rye 4%Rye 4%\\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 69}), Document(page_content='- 71 -  \\n Fig. 4.2-1: Division of agricultural area by arable practice (Federal Statistical Office, \\n2005b). \\nAgricultural suitability is distributed heterogeneously over Germany (Fig. 4.2-2). In \\nlarge parts of Germany, agricultural suitability is intermediate to good. The sandy and \\npoor soils in Brandenburg and in the “Geest” landscapes of North-western Germany \\nshow the lowest suitability. The highest su itability, and their for the highest yield \\npotential is found on the loess soils of the plains (“Börden”) of Magdeburg and Lower \\nSaxony, as well as on the soils of the upper Rhine rift. In large parts of Germany the \\nclimatic conditions are very good for agriculture (with the exception of the lower mountain ranges and the Alps). In the North, low average temperatures and short vegetation times cause some limitations, in the outer East of Germany very low \\nprecipitation is partially restraining.  \\nLow suitability (“Ackerzahl” ranked < 33)\\nMedium to good suitability (ranked 33-64)\\nVery good suitability (ranked >64)\\nLarger forest areas\\nLow suitability (“Ackerzahl” ranked < 33)\\nMedium to good suitability (ranked 33-64)\\nVery good suitability (ranked >64)\\nLarger forest areas \\nFig. 4.2-2: Suitability for agricultural use in Germany (Liedtke & Marcinek, 2002, \\nadapted). \\nAgricultural Reform an Economic Pressure \\nThe German agricultural sector is under pressure. The reduction of market supporting \\nmeasures (e.g. subsidies), increasing globalisation, eastward enlargement of the EU \\nand the liberalisation of prices since the EU agricultural reform (1992) and Agenda 2000 (1999) come with considerable economic risks to farmers. These developments ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 70}), Document(page_content='- 72 -  \\n caused strong competition and declining prices, which led to a destabilisation of \\nincomes in agriculture (Ortlof, 1998). In the last decades, this pressure caused a reduction in the number of farms by an average of 3% per year, while farm size grew continuously (Federal Government, 2005). \\nYields and Climate Change, Impacts of the Heat Wave in 2003 \\nIn the last fifty years, agricultural yields in Germany have increased steadily and more than tripled since 1950 (Fig. 4.2-3). This development can be observed worldwide and \\nis mainly a consequence of technological progress (Hafner, 2003). This includes \\nprogress in the development of new seeds, improvements in plant protection, new and improved sowing, cultivation and harvest techniques and enhanced fertilisation. If and how much climate change contributed to this development can so far not be \\nquantified.

Arrows mark dry years that caused distinct \\nyield losses (Sterzel, 2004). \\nA different impression is gained when looking at inter-annual differences in yields. This \\nreveals that climate variation, particularly climate extremes with long arid periods, \\nsuch as in the years 1964/65, 1972. 1992 and 2003, have repeatedly caused yield \\nlosses (Fig. 4.2-3). The year 2003 with it hot and dry summer was the year with the strongest yield losses in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany (Sterzel, 2004). Across Germany, the yields per hectare were approximately 12% below \\nmultiple year averages. Regionally, the damages were distributed very \\nheterogeneously. While Schleswig-Holstein, with its generally cool and moist climate, profited in the warm and dry year of 2003 with an increase in yields by 7.9%, \\nBrandenburg was the federal state that was most severely hit, with yield losses of 40% ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 71}), Document(page_content='- 73 -  \\n compared to multiple year averages (BMVEL, 2003). As a consequence of the yield \\nlosses, German federal states reported about 12,600 existentially threatened farms and damages of approximately 600 million € (Federal Government, 2004). \\nConcerning the assessment of impacts of climate change it is interesting to look at the \\nevents in 2003, since there is a consensus th at the prob ability of hot an d arid periods \\nhas already measurably increased and will further increase distinctly with climate \\nchange and the shift of precipitation fr om summer to winter (Schönwiese, 2005). \\nSome authors even see the year 2003 as a proxy for what expects us within the next 50-100 years (e.g. Beniston, 2004). This year also showed how important local \\nconditions are for the sensitivity to climate extremes. Regions that are less suitable for \\nagricultural use were most severely hit by yield losses, e.g. regions with poor soils of low water retention capacity (sandy soils), an unfavourable climatic water balance (see chapter 4.1) and high summer temperatures (see chapter 3). Such regions are found \\nprimarily in the federal state Brandenburg, parts of Saxony, as well as parts of South-\\nwestern Germany. \\nIn the past, there were also a number of other climate and weather extremes that \\ncaused considerable damages, such as hail, extreme rainfall and flood events. For example, the flood events at Elbe and Danube caused damages of approximately 200 \\nmillion € to farms and approximately 1.9 b illion € to agricultural infrastructure \\n(including dykes), with Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt reporting the largest damages (Federal Government, 2004). \\nThe elongated vegetation period and chan ges phenology of crops are impacts of \\nclimate change that can already be observed in Germany. For example, the development of ears in winter rye has moved to approximately 7 days earlier since \\n1960 in Germany (DWD, 2004). \\n4.2.4  Impacts of Climate Change – Trends and Projections \\nImpacts of Climate Change of Yield Potential \\nStudies on the impacts of climate change generally expect an increase in agricultural \\nyield in Europe. For example, an increase in wheat yield by 1-3 t ha-1 is estimated for \\nCentral Europe by 2050 (Harrison et al., 2003; IPCC, 2001). However, the significance \\nof water supply and the risk of yield losses through water stress are not yet adequately accounted for in these studies. Cu rrently there are no explicit scenarios of \\ncrop yield across the whole of Germany.  \\nFor example, more explicit scenarios, which account for possibly insufficient water \\nsupply, are available for the Elbe watershed. Model runs estimated decreases in yield \\nof wheat, rye and barley by 9% to 14% by  the year 2055, under the assumption of a \\ntemperature increase by 1.4ºC and a decrease in annual precipitation by 10%. This was mainly caused by insufficient water supply in summer. According to these \\nscenarios only maize, as a thermophilic plant profiting from temperature increase and \\nwith good water use efficiency, did not exhibit any impairment and showed regional yield increases in areas with good water supply (Wechsung et al., 2004). \\nFurther results for Baden-Württemberg are available from the project KLARA (PIK, \\n2005). Similarly, the assumption of decreased precipitation in summer leads to a decrease in wheat yield by 14% by 2055. This was caused by insufficient water supply, \\nbut also by negative impacts of temperature increase (shortening the phase of grain \\nmaturation). As in the Elbe watershed, maize was fairly insensitive to climate change and profited slightly. \\nBesides long term climate trends, climate variations from year to year (inter-annual \\nvariability) and climatic extremes play a big role in agriculture. These climate \\nvariations possibly pose the greatest threat to agriculture. Results from regional \\nclimate models indicate that inter-annual variability of temperature and precipitation will distinctly increase in future in Europe, particularly in summer (Schär et al., 2004; \\nGiorgi et al., 2004). Climate variations hamper adaptation and have regularly led to \\nyield losses in the past. The increased probability of heat extremes and arid periods, a ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 72}), Document(page_content='- 74 -  \\n simple consequence of warming and shifts of precipitation into winter alone, is of \\nparticular significance in this respect. Other climate and weather extremes (hail extreme rainfall) may also occur more frequently, but currently no unambiguous results are available for this.  \\nViticulture is a special case, since here the quality of the yield is of utmost importance, \\nrather than the quantity. Temperature has a strong influence on the sugar content of \\nthe grapes and the choice of vine variety. Studies of selected regions show that the \\nwine-growing area in Germany will shift northward and vine varieties of higher quality may be cultivated. According to one stud y, by 2045 the cultivation of Cabernet \\nSauvignon would be possible in the Rheingau, and Potsdam could grow high-quality \\nRiesling or Chardonnay (Stock et al., 2004). \\nFurther Impacts of Climate Change \\nTemperature increase will lead to further shifts to earlier dates and shortening of \\nphonological phases. Due to this, sowing and harvesting can shift to earlier dates, and \\nthe harvest security of crops with long de velopment, such as e.g. maize and millet, \\nincreases. On the other hand, a more rapid development through phenological phases \\nmay decrease yields. \\nMoreover, a shift in the range of suitable crops to the North and into higher altitudes is \\nexpected. While Northern regions such as Scandinavia can strongly profit from this, for \\nGermany only minor changes are expected. In a study of 27 crop types that could \\npotentially be used as renewable primary resources (among which the common cereal types), the range of suitable crops within Germany was slightly decreased (Fig. 4.2-4; \\nchanges between +8 and –17%). On the one hand, the cultivation of some new crops \\nwill be possible by 2080, such as e.g. so y bean in parts of Germany (South-western \\nGermany), on the other hand the suitability of some classic crops such as rye, oats \\nand potato decreases. \\nRenewable Primary Resources – N umber of Suitable Crops [%]\\n-17.4 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆25.2%)\\n-12.7 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆20.5%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-17.4 --5.2%\\n(∆12.2%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2[%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080Renewable Primary Resources – N umber of Suitable Crops [%]\\n-17.4 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆25.2%)\\n-12.7 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆20.5%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-17.4 --5.2%\\n(∆12.2%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2[%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-17.4 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆25.2%)\\n-12.7 -7 . 8  %\\n(∆20.5%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-17.4 --5.2%\\n(∆12.2%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2[%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080\\n \\nFig. 4.2-4: Change in number of suitable crops that can be used as renewable \\nprimary resources in Germany in 2080 compared to baseline (1990) in percent (%). Results for seven ATEAM scenarios are shown (see chapter 2). \\nAnother effect of rising temperatures is the loss of organic carbon from soil due to an \\naccelerated rate of decomposition and mineralization of organic material in agricultural soils. This loss of organic carbon decreases soil fertility and contributes to the \\ngreenhouse effect through emissions of carbon dioxide. Results from the ATEAM \\nproject (see chapter 2) show that due to  temperature increase by 2100 alone, 20-30% \\nof European soil carbon will be lost. A decrease of soil organic carbon by 40-60% is possible if climate change induced changes in  crop productivity and expected land use \\nchanges are taken into account (Smith et al. in Schröter et al. 2004).

Many pest species profit in general from higher temperatures, particularly higher winter temperatures. In consequence, pests can establish earlier in the year and can \\nproduce more individuals and generations. F ungal pests will only profit from warmer \\nand simultaneously moister weather conditions. Exemplary results concerning this issue for pests and diseases in apple orchards are available from the project KLARA. \\nAccording to these results, warmer and slightly moister climate in the region around \\nLake Constance will increase pest pressure on apple production through the codling moth (larvae of the butterfly Cydia pomonella ) and apple scab (caused by the fungus \\nVenturia inaequalis ) (PIK, 2005).  \\nFurther impacts of climate change include decreasing quality of the crops, mainly \\nthrough decreasing protein content (IPCC, 2001), damages of crops through increased \\natmospheric ozone concentrations (Welling, 2000), and increased risk of (wind) \\nerosion because of more arid soils (Olesen & Bindi, 2002). \\nImpacts of the Agricultural Reform and Changing Economic Conditions \\nBesides climate change, changes in socio-economic conditions determine the future of \\nGerman agriculture. A polarisation of agricultural landscapes is expected, dividing regions with favourable arable conditions from areas that will not be able to sustain profitable agriculture in a changing market. This is a consequence of the agricultural \\nreform, liberalisation of the market, and the decrease of world prices for many \\nagricultural products. These trends are currently under debate, but most experts expect a decrease in the total area used for agriculture, especially in less favourable \\nareas. The proportion of abandoned land in Germany could increase by up to 40%, the \\narea used for cereal production could decrease by 12-25%, and grassland could be widely extensified (Kleinhanß et al., 2003). \\n-24.7 --12.4 %\\n(∆12.3%)\\n-23.6 --23.2 %\\n(∆0.4%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-24.7 --12.4 %\\n(∆12.3%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2Relative Change in Ag ricultural Area [%][%]\\n-30 -20 -10 0\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-24.7 --12.4 %\\n(∆12.3%)\\n-23.6 --23.2 %\\n(∆0.4%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n-24.7 --12.4 %\\n(∆12.3%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2Relative Change in Ag ricultural Area [%][%]\\n-30 -20 -10 0\\n1990 2020 2050 2080\\n \\nFig. 4.2-5: Relative change in agricultural area by 2080 compared to 1990 in \\nGermany for seven ATEAM scenarios.  \\nSome scenarios show a decrease in agricultural area in the Elbe watershed by up to \\n34%, on the less favourable areas in Eastern Germany regionally even by up to 60%, \\nunder the assumption of a continued liberalisation of the market (Wechsung et al., 2004).

Sector-specific ratings \\nof potential elements and impacts of climate change are available for various \\nenvironmental zones (see chapter 2.6) in the following six federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Thuringia, Saxony, and \\nHesse. Positive ratings are regarded as acknowledgments of opportunities, negative \\nratings as acknowledgments of risks. The resu lts of the survey are depicted in Fig. 4.2-\\n6. The assessment, which is discussed in the following, must be seen as preliminary, \\nsince only one expert per federal state was approached and the return of the \\nquestionnaires from the 16 federal states was scarce. On the other hand, more than half of the respondents base their assessment on studies of past and future climate development; two respondents were also familiar with studies on the impacts of \\nclimate change on agriculture. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nRespondents rated the impacts of climate ch ange on agriculture on average over all \\nenvironmental zones and federal states in recent times (1990 to today) as “slightly \\nnegative”. The responses for specific environmental zones and federal states ranged from “negative” to “neither positive nor negative”. In the short (today to 2010) and medium (2010 to 2020) term ratings were on average “slightly negative”, in the long \\nterm (2020 to 2050) on average “negative”. It is striking that – in spite of existing \\nopportunities in agriculture due to climate change – the general assessment of climate change for almost all environmental zones and federal states is in the negative range, \\nand that the ratings increase in negativity into the future. \\nRisk Assessment \\nExperts rated two potential elements of climate change  as on average “negative” \\nalready in the short term: the potential decrease in annual precipitation14 and the \\npotential increase of hot days and heat waves. Stronger variations in precipitation, less \\nfrost days, and more frequent extreme rainfall events were rated as “slightly negative” in the short term. In the medium and long term most ratings become more negative. \\nThe pattern of responses for increasing average annual, winter and summer \\ntemperatures are interesting. For some environmental zones and federal states these increases were rated positively, in the medium term, however, they are rated \\nneutrally, and in the long term negatively. On the other hand, these temperature \\nchanges are often rated extremely differently depending on environmental zone, ranging from “very negative” to “positive”. \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n                                              \\n \\n14 According to the present state of knowledge increases and decreases in annual \\nprecipitation are possible, depending on th e region.

Negative ratings are the majority. \\nThis holds already for the ratings of the past since 1990. Yield losses on croplands \\nthrough drought stress, and yield losses through extreme events (storm, hail, flood) on cropland and grassland, are rated as “n egative” already in the short term – with \\nmarked differences in grassland losses between different environmental zones and \\nfederal states. Respondents rated the yield losses due to drought stress on grassland in summer, the expansion of (new) pest spec ies, and the decline of soil fertility in \\ncrop- and grassland as slightly less negative. With almost all risks, there is a trend \\ntoward increasingly negative ratings in the medium and long term. \\nOpportunity Assessment \\nOnly one of the potential elements of climate change  is on average rated as an \\nopportunity: the possible increase in annual precipitation. In the short, medium and \\nlong term this is seen as “slightly positive”. However, differences between ratings increase over time, and range in the long term across the entire scale from “very \\nnegative” to “very positive”, depending on environmental zone. \\nAmong the potential impacts of climate change , respondents rated the possibly earlier \\nsowing dates and improved cultivation potential for specific crops (e.g. maize, millet) \\nin the future on average as “positive”. Increases in yield potential (owing to increasing \\ntemperature and CO\\n2-content) on crop- and grassland are seen as “slightly positive”. \\nPositive ratings on average stayed constant, while in contrast the negative ratings \\nbecame increasingly negative over time from the short, over medium to long term. \\nFurther Impacts \\nWe also asked about further potential impacts of climate change in the agricultural \\nsector. Respondents listed CO2-enrichment that increases photosynthesis, crop type \\nrotations that increase soil organic matter in bioenergy crop plantations on potentially \\nretired land, the cultivation of new, drough t-resistant varieties, the use of genetic \\nengineering, and later sowing in winter crops. \\n4.2.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nIn the past, agriculture has proven to be very adaptable to changes in environmental \\nconditions, as linearly increasing yields show. This high adaptive capacity is based on the one hand on short term planning horizons (few years), and on the other hand on \\nthe possibility to maintain high yields through changing conditions through the use of \\nnew cultivars or technological development.  \\nChanges in cultivation and management are adaptation measures available to \\nagriculture: \\n• Change in sowing date : Summer cereals can be sowed earlier due to increasing \\ntemperatures. This brings the advantages of higher soil moisture levels in the early \\nyear, potentially increased yield through longer growth phase, and decreased risk from water stress. On the other hand, the risk of damages through late frosts increases. Winter cereal should be sowed later than currently customary, to avoid \\ndamages through a late onset of the cold phase, which is important for \\ndevelopment. \\n• Choice of suitable cultivars : These include cultivars that are less sensitive to \\ndrought stress. Generally, robust varieties with wide climatic tolerance and low susceptibility to pests should be preferred over sensitive high-performance \\ncultivars.  \\n• Adaptation of crop rotation and introduction of new crop types : More suitable crop \\ntypes should replace crop types that prove to be less suitable under changed \\nclimatic conditions. Thermophilic crop types with high water use efficiency seem \\nespecially suitable, such as e.g. some maize cultivars or millet. Diversification of ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 77}), Document(page_content='- 79 -  \\n the range of crop types lessens the risk of yield losses through climate extremes \\nand damages through pest outbreaks. \\n• Use of soil-fertility maintaining and water-saving management options : These \\ninclude application of mulch and plough-less soil treatment. These practices lower \\nwater losses through transpiration, and decrease the release of carbon and the risk \\nof erosion. \\n• Adaptation of fertilisation and pest management : The use of fertilisers needs to be \\nadapted to an increased demand for nitrogen with increasing CO 2-content. On the \\nother hand, increased nitrogen fertilisation increases water use, so that a suitable \\nbalance needs to be achieved. Pest management should take account of risks \\nthrough new pest species early on. Integr ated methods should be favoured. The \\nchoice of robust cultivars and a diverse range of crop types contribute to plant protection. \\n• Cultivation of renewable primary resources for energy generation : This adaptation \\nmeasure contributes to emission reduction, and is furthermore an alternative use \\nfor many agricultural areas in Germany that  will probably cease to be needed for \\nfood and fodder production in the long term. \\nMoreover, financial safeguarding  in the face of risks of yield losses plays an important \\nrole. In Germany, insurances for the agricultural sector are currently largely restricted to insurance against hail. Damages like the yield losses through the 2003 heat wave are only covered partly by federal ad hoc measures. The introduction of a “multiple \\nrisk insurance”, which has long been common practice in the USA, is an option for an \\nexpanded coverage of risks. \\n4.2.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the expert survey (method described in chapter 2.6) on \\nmeasures that are suitable for climate ch ange adaptation from the following seven \\nfederal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse, and Saarland. The following results of the survey must be \\nseen as very preliminary assessment of the measures that are suitable to adapt the \\nGerman agricultural sector to climate change, since only one expert per federal state was approached and the return of the questionnaires from the federal states was scarce. \\nIn the survey, different dimensions of the adaptation measures were evaluated; the \\neffectiveness of the measure to mitigate the risks introduced in section 4.2.5, \\nalternatively to capitalize on the opportuni ties of climate change (see Tab. 4-2), and \\nthe present degree of implementation of the adaptation measure (see Fig. 4.2-7). \\nCultivation of Adapted Crop Types \\nRespondents assigned the cultivation of adap ted crop types a wide range of positive \\neffects with regard to the impacts of climate change on agriculture, both regarding opportunities (increasing yield potential, possibly earlier sowing, improved cultivation conditions for some crop types) and regarding risks of climate change (yield losses \\nthrough drought stress and extreme events, ex pansion of pest species; see Tab. 4-2). \\nMerely with regard to the risk of declining soil fertility, no respondent sees the cultivation of adapted crops as effective. \\nTab. 4-2: Rating of the degree of effectiv eness of adaptation measures to mitigate \\nrisks and capitalize on opportunities of climate change in the agricultural sector.

But the variation between federal states is large. The highest degrees of implementation (“partially \\nimplemented”) are reported from Brandenburg and Saxony. Reasons for the cultivation \\nof new crop types were said to be the creation of new income sources for farmers, the \\nincrease of biodiversity, as well as the improved drought resistance of the new crop types. Again, only in one federal state the measure was implemented because of \\nclimate change.  \\nAccording to three respondents, lacking knowledge is an obstacle in cultivating new \\ncrops. One respondent names organisational hurdles as further problem. Specific \\nobstacles are mainly related to yield variability due to lacking experience with the cultivation of new crop types and to “undesired” climatic conditions (e.g. late frosts). Owing to these difficulties, respondents rated this measure as more complicated than \\nthe cultivation of adapted crop types. Th e average rating lies between “slightly \\ncomplicated” and “complicated”. \\nAdapted Irrigation Systems \\nAdapted irrigation systems are thought of being slightly less broadly effective with regard to adapting to impacts of climate ch ange than the cultivation of adapted or new \\ncrop types (see Tab. 4-2). All respondents regard this measure as suitable to capitalize \\non the opportunity of increased yield potentia l. In the context of climatic risks, the \\nmeasure is seen as particularly effective to avoid yield losses through drought stress.  \\nOn average, adapted irrigation systems ar e rated as “partially implemented”, with \\nlarge variations between different federal states (see Fig. 4.2-7). Eastern German \\nfederal states are the main contributors to  the high degree of implementation, because \\nthey have in the past been more affected by aridity than Western federal states, and \\nprobably will be even more affected in future due to climate change. However, only \\none respondent from Eastern Germany identi fied this risk of climate change as a \\ndecisive reason to implement adapted irrigation systems. Respondents from other \\nfederal states list as reasons to implement adapted irrigation systems among others \\nsecuring yield stability, the option to alleviate arid periods, and the strive to efficient water use. \\nAlmost all respondents see financial obstacles as main hindrances in implementing \\nirrigation systems. They name particularly the high investment costs in relation to irregular usage of the systems. Moreover, th ere are said to be legislative (water use \\nrestrictions) and ecological hurdles. On average, respondents rated the measure as \\n“complicated”. Two respondents even replied “very complicated”.  \\nNew Cultivation Methods to Maintain Soil-Fertility and Save Water \\nThis measure has been rated to have the broadest spectrum of effectiveness among \\nthe discussed measures (see Tab. 4-2). For every listed potential impacts of climate \\nchange, at least one respondent saw new cu ltivation methods as effective adaptation \\nmeasure.  \\nThe degree of implementation is rated on average as “partially implemented”, with \\nonly slight differences between federal states (see Fig. 4.2-7). Two of the seven \\nrespondents named climate change explicitly as a reason to implement new cultivation \\nmethods. As further reasons reduced costs, reduced erosion, maintaining soil-quality, saving water, and securing yield stability were listed. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 80}), Document(page_content='- 82 -  \\n Few obstacles for the implementation of new cultivation methods were named. One \\nrespondent saw “legislative hurdles”, an other “lacking knowledge”. Respondents \\npointed out that the economic success of new cultivation methods depends strongly on farm-specific advantages and disadvantages and could hardly be generalised. With \\nregards to these few obstacles, respondents saw this measure on average as “not \\ncomplicated”. \\nMeasures integrating several risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nRespondents saw insurances against damages through climate change and the creation of reserve funds for future adaptation measures and damage reparation payments as effective over a narrow range of issues (see Tab. 4-2). Such measures were thought of as effective mainly to buffer yield losses through drought stress or \\nextreme events. In comparison to the other sectors that were surveyed (particularly \\nnature conservation), in agriculture respondents attributed a relatively high effectiveness to measures integrating several risks.  \\nOn average across federal states, respondent s rated the degree of implementation of \\nboth measures as rather low, namely “currently considered” (see Fig. 4.2-7). In all \\nfederal states, insurances are already on the agenda, but reserve fund building is not. \\nBrandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomera nia (hail insurance only) reported the \\nhighest degree of implementation (“partially  implemented”) for insurances. According \\nto respondents, the creation of reserve funds is in the farthest stage of implementation \\nin the states Brandenburg and Thuringia (“partially implemented”). The reasons to \\nimplement these measures were listed as previous flood experiences, general financial risks, and the general uncertainty of the fu ture. Only Brandenburg’s respondent listed \\nclimate change as one of the reasons to buy insurances and create reserve funds. \\nAccording to most respondents, there are financial obstacles in getting insurances and \\nbuilding reserve funds. They argue that capital resources of many agricultural \\nenterprises were not big enough and that bu ilding public support of the insurance fees \\nneeds to be pursued more vigorously. As further obstacles, legislative hurdles and gaps in knowledge were listed. Respondents also mentioned that the responsibility for \\ninsurance against risk was not clearly divided between public and private bodies. One \\nexpert suggested pursuing federal or EU-wid e solutions. Broad distribution of federal \\nreserves and insurances would also spread  the risk widely. With regard to these \\nobstacles, respondents rated both measures as “complicated”, while to this only four \\nout of seven experts responded at all. \\nFurther Measures \\nAt the end of the survey, experts were asked for further measures that may be suitable to prevent risks of climate chan ge or capitalize on opportunities. The \\nrespondents gratefully took up this opportunity and listed, among others, the following measures: higher drought resistance and robustness of crop plants e.g. through \\nbreeding and genetic engineering; targeted and decreased use of fertilisers and \\npesticides together with improvements in so il organic content; expansion of irrigation \\nsystems, as well as improved water holding capacity of the soils; targeted weather \\nforecasts fro farmers by meteorological services; new crop rotation systems to \\nminimise case specific, climate related risks, as well as increased cultivation of C\\n4-\\nplants to increase biomass production. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Agricultural Departments \\nThe experts from functional departments on agriculture in the federal states were also asked about activities of their administration to adapt the impacts of climate change. Respondents replied that there was indeed an ongoing discussion about the issue of \\nadapting to climate change in their admini stration. However, from other responses we \\ngot the impression that this response related more to initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation). \\nPractical initiatives to adapt to the impacts of climate change were only reported from \\nthree federal states: In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the development of soil ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 81}), Document(page_content='- 83 -  \\n management techniques that prevent water and wind erosion through the LfA, the \\nexpansion of water-saving cultivation methods, and experimentation with the cultivation of thermophilic plants (soy); in Saxony among others, sparing soil management, experiments with crop rotation, and monitoring of pest occurrence; and \\nin Brandenburg the encouragement of irriga tion and drainage, and the programme to \\ncreate cultural landscapes (Kulturlandschaffungsprogramm, KULAP). \\nAsked about the relevance of the issue of adaptation in comparison to other issues in \\ntheir administration, two respondents answered “important” (Saxony and Brandenburg), two “slightly important”, and two “unimportant”. In none of the \\nadministrations the issue was rated as “very important”. Adaptation to the impacts of \\nclimate change therefore seems to be of variable significance in the agricultural departments of the various federal states, but was never seen as being of high importance. \\nAdaptation in the Agricultural Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nThe cultivation of adapted varieties, and new, adapted cultivation techniques to conserve soils and save water are seen as broadly effective measures to mitigate \\npotential risks and capitalize on potential benefits of climate change. Moreover, the \\ncultivation of new crop types, and adapted irrigation systems were rated as effective in many ways. For each potential impact of climate change, respondent named two, for some potential impacts even more, effective adaptation measures. \\nAmong the six measures about which was enquired, three were on average rated by \\nrespondents as only “currently considered”: cultivation of new crop types, insurances \\nagainst damages, and the creation of reserve funds. The three further measures – \\ncultivation of adapted varieties, adapted irrigation systems, and new cultivation techniques – were rated on the qualitative scale on average two steps higher, namely \\nas “partially implemented”. However, the range of responses was wide, and there were \\nlarge differences in the degree of implementation of measures between federal states. Some federal states seem to lag behind. Furthermore, we would like to stress that – except for one respondent – no expert rated even a single measure as already \\n“implemented”. \\nHowever, there were few obstacles, so that respondents rated the implementation of \\nmeasures on average, and particularly in comparison to other sectors (particularly \\nnature conservation) as little complicated. Of little complexity seemed especially the cultivation of new crop types and the implementation of new cultivation techniques – \\nmeasures that were also seen as widely effective regarding various impacts of climate \\nchange. If the awareness of risks and opportuni ties of climate change can be raised in \\nagriculture, there seem to be few diffic ulties in adapting to climate change. \\nRespondents named weather extremes, sometimes very specific events in the past, as \\ntriggering events for the implementation of measures that are also suitable to adapt to climate change. However, climate change is only named by Brandenburg, and to a \\nlesser degree by Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as one of the reasons for the \\nimplementation of measures. Currently a debate about climate change takes place \\nonly in few agricultural departments of federal states that were surveyed. We \\ntherefore conclude that impacts of climate change have not or only sparsely been \\nconsidered in the planning of measures, and that agriculture in most federal states is not yet adapted to future impacts of climate change. The risks of the past (particularly \\nweather extremes) have been considered, but not the anticipated changing conditions \\nin eh future. Because extreme weather events are considered, there is an awareness of the demand for adaptation measures. The challenge is to expand this awareness to the opportunities and risks of other, more long-term climate impacts. \\nIn general, the adaptive capacity of German agriculture should be high with regard to \\nfuture impacts of climate change. In agriculture, highly effective but little complicated \\nmeasures are available (mainly the cultivation of new crop types and the use of new \\ncultivation techniques), which is a rare opportunity.  \\nFederal states should use the opportuni ty to exchange their experience and ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 82}), Document(page_content='- 84 -  \\n knowledge, since the degree of implementation  of adaptation measures and the state \\nof present discussion on adaptation to climate change was very different between some federal states.

Opportunities arise \\nthrough increased yield potential and the possibility to introduce new tree species. \\nRisks arise through partly profound potential impacts of climate change, and through \\nthe long time scale and complexity of implementing adaptation measures in the \\nforestry sector. Threats to forestry can be listed on several levels: \\nTree species : Among the main tree species, Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) is particularly \\nimpacted by climate change. Norway spruce prefers moist, cool stands and its \\nresistance to heat and aridity is limited. Sp ruce is often already currently grown at the \\nlimit of its range of tolerance, because due to its high growth potential it is grown in \\nmany places outside its natural habitat. Furthermore, spruce is particularly susceptible \\nto the indirect impacts of climate change, such as calamities (bark beetle, e.g. Ips \\ntypographus and Pityogenes chalcographus, Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and damages \\nthrough extreme events (windbreak). The sensit ivity of spruce to climate change is of \\nparticular economic importance, since spruce is the most frequently planted tree \\nspecies in Germany. Beech trees ( Fagus sylvatica ) are also hygrophile and sensitive, \\nbut not to the extent of spruce. Only those stands where beech reaches its limit of \\naridity are threatened, and beech is usually grown at suitable sites. Oak ( Quercus  \\nspec.), Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) and non-native Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga \\nmenziesii ) are relatively less sensitive. However, especially in pine monoculture, the \\nrisk of forest fires will increase considerably with climate change. \\nForest ecosystems : Mixed forests are less sensitive than coniferous forests, since they \\ncan better adapt to climate change. High gene tic diversity also decreases sensitivity.  \\nRegions : Within Germany, those regions are particularly vulnerable that struggle with \\nlow water availability already today (parts of Eastern Germany), that expect \\nparticularly large temperature variation (South-western Germany), and that grow \\nspruce outside its natural range of distribution (Southern and Western Germany). Less \\nvulnerable are coastal areas (relatively small change in climate, low risk of drought), \\nthe alpine upland, and large parts of the lower mountain ranges. \\nTo date, the forestry sector is adapted to the impacts of climate change only to a \\ncertain degree. On the one hand, the discussion about climate change is most intense \\ncompared to the other examined climate-sensitive sectors, but on the other hand, the \\nfull implementation of planned adaptation measures to climate change often takes \\nseveral decades in the forestry sector. In some regions, measures still need to be \\nplanned. Consequently, we rate the vulnerability of the forestry sector to climate \\nchange without further measures as “moderate” (business-as-usual scenario, see \\nchapter 2.8). Only the drought prone region s (Eastern Germany), as well as regions \\nwith strong temperature increase and a high proportion of out-of-natural-habitat \\nspruce stands (lower regions in Western and Southern Germany) are rated as \\npresently “highly vulnerable”. \\nHowever, the forestry sector should have a high capacity to adapt to the impacts of \\nclimate change more than today, since a range of effective adaptation measures are \\navailable, even if these are often rated as “complicated”. The shift to mixed forests \\nand the maintenance of genetic diversity were seen as broadly effective in responding \\nto a range of uncertain risks and opportunities of climate change, since these \\nmeasures maintain or broaden the capability to adapt. The economic pressure that \\neach forest owner has to bear will also be decisive for the adaptive capacity of the \\nforest sector. In this regard, the adaptation  of privately owned forests relies on special \\nsupport. We expect that the vulnerability of the forestry sector to climate change can \\nbe rated as “low”, if the suggested adaptation measures are implemented (improved-\\nbusiness scenario, see chapter 2.8). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 86}), Document(page_content='- 88 -  \\n 4.3.2  Forestry and Climate  \\nForests are typical, multifunctional ecosystems. As providers of wood and fibre they \\noffer us provisioning ecosystem services (see chapter 1.3). Locally, they protect from \\nerosion, avalanches, immission and noise (pro tecting function), they have a positive \\nimpact on the water balance and the local climate (regulating ecosystem service), and \\nprovide opportunities for recreation (cul tural ecosystem service). They are also \\nimportant for biodiversity and nature conservation (Häusler & Scherer-Lorenzen, 2002). In Central Europe, forests are the ecosystems richest in species diversity. Some forms of forestry threaten biodiversity. Forestry poses a risk to 338 of the 711 \\nthreatened fern and angiosperm (flowering  plant) species (Korneck & Sukkop, 1988) \\nand to approximately 800 of the approximat ely 1700 threatened animal species (Bode, \\n1997). Finally, forests are important for climate regulation as potential sinks of carbon \\n(see below).  \\nForestry is tightly linked to climate and weather conditions. Climatic conditions \\ndetermine to a large part the range of suitable tree species and the yield potential of \\nspecific species. The course of weather conditions is decisive for variations in the occurrence of phenological phases such as bud break and blooming, and for biomass increment. Weather extremes, such as stor ms or extreme rainfall events, but also \\ndrought and heat waves, can permanently damage forests. \\nThe principal interaction between climate an d plant physiology, plant growth and plant \\ndevelopment have already been described in the chapter on agriculture and are \\nanalogue for forestry (see chapter 4.2). In the following we will therefore only describe sets of factors or complex climate impacts on forests. \\nYield Potential and Water Supply \\nIn principle, similar to agriculture, climate change is expected to increase yield potential in forestry. This is on the one hand due to the “fertilising” effect of the increased CO\\n2-content of the air. CO 2 enhances photosynthetic activity and water use \\nefficiency (Jarvis, 1998). On the other hand, rising temperatures increase \\nphotosynthetic rate and other metabolic processes until a certain temperature optimum. Furthermore, a temperature increase  leads to a longer vegetation period and \\ntherefore to a longer growth phase. In experiments, a doubling of CO\\n2-content of the \\nair led to a growth increase by 20% in  trees on average (Norby et al., 1999). \\nHowever, in case of a temperature increase of much more than approximately 2ºC negative effect will prevail in most native tree species (Hirschberg et al., 2003). \\nIt strongly depends on water and nutrient supply if an increase in temperature and \\nCO\\n2-content will actually increase yields in a specific location, with water supply \\nprobably being the future limiting factor (Flaig et al., 2003). \\nWater supply depends on the one hand on water availability, on the other on the \\ndemand of the forests. With increasing temperatures water demand increases owing to \\nincreased plant and soil evaporation (evapotranspiration). \\nOn the assumption of a decrease of precipitation in future as a consequence of climate \\nchange, water supply would decrease as well. Furthermore, declining groundwater tables as a consequence of melioration measures and increased water extractions can decrease water supply. The impacts of decreased water supply are drought stress, \\nimpaired growth and drought damages. The su sceptibility to drought stress varies with \\nspecies. For example, while spruce and beech exhibit low drought resistance, pine is relatively robust concerning drought stress.  According to an experts’ survey, drought \\nstress is the most relevant impact of climate change on forest growth (Spiecker et al., \\n2000). \\nShifts in Species Distribution and Tree Species Composition \\nClimate is one of the main factors determining the composition of tree species in the potential natural vegetation, as well as the suitability of specific species for use in forestry. Long-term climate changes lead to changes in local conditions and therefore ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 87}), Document(page_content='- 89 -  \\n shift species distribution. Many forest ecosystems today are already under increased \\nadaptation pressure, since forests need a long time to adapt to environmental \\nchanges. This pressure is stronger the more local ecological conditions will change in future (Borchert & Kölling, 2004). Tree species with a small range of tolerance are \\nparticularly sensitive (e.g. fir, Abies alba ) ,  a s  w e l l  a s  s p e c i e s  t h a t  r e l y  o n  c o o l  a n d  \\nmoist conditions (e.g. spruce). \\nPests and Pathogens \\nAnimal (insects) and non-animal pests (fungi) usually profit from rising temperatures. Pests and pathogens generally adapt rapidly to climate conditions, due to their short generation times and high mobility. The susceptibility of forests to pests, however, can be increased by prior climatic damages, such as drought or windbreak.  \\nWhen temperatures are high and vegetation pe riod is long, animal pests, such as e.g. \\nthe bark beetle, can produce several generations per year, leading to increased \\nabundance over longer periods of time. Mild winters also increase their reproductive \\nsuccess. Moreover, insect pests can spread further North and higher in altitude. New invasive pest species are expected (Ulrich & Puhe, 1994). However, we would like to \\nstress that different insect pest species can react very differently to climate change.  \\nRisk of Forest Fires \\nThe risk of forest fires is influenced by two sets of factors: people’s behaviour and \\nclimatic or weather conditions. A climate related risk of forest fires increases the \\nprobability of forest fires, however most fires are triggered by human activity (Badeck \\net al., 2004b). Generally, the risk of fore st fires increases in dry, hot summers. \\nImpacts of Extreme Weather Events – Storm Damages \\nAmong coniferous trees, spruce and Douglas fir are particularly sensitive to windbreak; \\namong deciduous trees this is true particularly for beech, birch ( Betula pendula ) and \\npoplar ( Populus  spec.). Mixed stands are thought to be less sensitive. Previously \\ndamaged trees are particularly at risk (Ulrich & Puhe, 1994). Storm damages increase \\nthe risk of insect calamities, particularly through the infestation with bark beetles. \\n4.3.3  Baseline Situation: Forestry in Germany \\nWith a forest area of 11.1 million hectares (ha), one third of Germany is forested. \\nAlmost three-quarters of the forests (73%) are mixed stands. Norway spruce ( Picea \\nabies) is grown on a little more than a quarter (28%) of the forested land and is \\ntherefore the most common tree species in Germany. This is followed by pine ( Pinus \\nsylvestris ) with 23%, beech ( Fagus Sylvatica ) with 15%, and common and sessile oak \\n(Quercus robur  and Q. petraea ) with 10% (Fig. 4.3-1a; BMVEL, 2004). Forty-six \\npercent of the forest is privately owned, 34% are owned by the federal states or the federal government, and 20% are owned by towns, communities and other corporate \\nbodies (Fig. 4.3-1b). The forestry sect or employs approximately 175,000 people and \\naccounts for approximately 3% of gross national product (DFWR, 2001). \\nRecent Development \\nThe percentage of deciduous trees, particularly of beech trees, has distinctly increased \\nin the last 15 years, as a consequence of management measures (forest conversion \\nprogrammes), while the percentage of coniferous trees decreased. Total forest area also increased slightly, on average by approximately 3500 ha per year.

With an average of 320 stored solid cubic \\nmeters of wood per hectare they are not only at their peak compared to historical records, but also obtain a leading position relative to European neighbouring countries. \\nWood increment is also relatively high: In the old federal states an annual increment \\nof on average 12.6 stored solid cubic meters were observed during the period 1987 to 2002 (average across all tree species and age classes). This trend has been observed \\nfor many other European countries as well (Spiecker et al., 1996). On average, only \\ntwo-thirds of this increment is harvested. Since less wood is used than annual growth adds, the stock of wood and age of the forests and trees increases. This bears \\nadvantages (older forests usually are more diverse, rich in structure and store more \\ncarbon) and risks: with increasing age the susceptibility of trees to environmental \\nstress increases and the risk of depreciation of wood through calamities increases (BMVEL, 2004). \\nNovel Damages to Forests \\nSince the mid 1970s, novel damages to forests have been recorded on wide areas within the whole of Europe. When originally mostly fir and spruce were impacted, damages now occur increasingly also on deciduous trees, particularly beech. Interplay \\nbetween various abiotic influences (pollution, nitrogen deposition, weather conditions) \\nand biotic factors (calamities) is speculated to be the root cause of this. Among these factors, pollution is seen as the most important cause. Since the mid 1980s, the health \\nstatus of German forests is regularly monitored in forest damage inventories, mainly \\nfocussing on the indicator “crown transparency”.  \\nIn the year 2004, 72% of all trees exhibited distinct crown transparency or were rated \\nas “in stage of alert”. This was the highest level of recorded damage since the beginning of forest damage inventories. For the first time, the main reason for this high level of damage in 2004 is not thought to be pollution, but the weather conditions \\nin the hot and dry “record summer” of 2003, and its side- and after-effects. These are \\ndirect damage through drought and radiation; damage through increased ozone content of the air, as a consequence of intensive solar radiation; and the spread of \\ncalamities as a consequence of the mild winter in 2003, as well as prior damages \\nthrough direct weather impacts (BMVEL, 2004). \\nCurrent Impacts of Climate Change \\nAn early sign of climate change may be the increase of wood increment described \\nabove. The main cause of this is thought to be nitrogen deposition from the \\natmosphere, but the increasing warming and the elongation of the vegetation period do indeed contribute to increased wood growth. The vegetation period of the main ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 89}), Document(page_content='- 91 -  \\n forest tree species in Europe and Germany has already been elongated by 10-11 days \\nfrom the 1960s to the 1990s of the 20th century (Menzel, 1997; Badeck et al., 2004a).  \\nGerman forests are primarily at risk through drought stress. This is true particularly for \\nthe warm and dry areas in the Northeast an d Southwest of Germany. Moreover, in the \\nSouthwest spruce as the main tree species is little resistant to aridity. In the North, especially in the Northeast, sandy soils with low water holding capacity increase the \\nrisk of drought stress. Furthermore, stan ds close to groundwater table (lowland \\nriparian forest) are at risk through declining groundwater tables (Gerstengarbe et al., 2003). \\nThe heat wave in the summer of 2003 shows how strongly yield potential can be \\nthreatened by drought stress. Drought and high temperatures led to a near total depletion of the water reserves in forest soils available to plants. In \\nAugust/September, the water uptake of trees in many stands was strongly impaired. \\nThe consequent water deficiency had profound impacts in many forest areas. Premature shedding of leaves and needles, actinocutitis (sunburn) and a general \\ndecrease of vitality of the forest trees were  observed. This led to a poor status of tree \\ncrowns in 2004, but also to e.g. decreased increment and resistance to pests (BMVEL, \\n2004). Damages through extreme weather conditions such as in the year 2003 can \\ncontinue to have an effect over more than 10 years, and can lead to changes growth \\ntrends in the long term, beyond actual reduced growth rates (Anders et al., 2004). \\nIn 2003, the connection between drought, heat and risk of pest infestation became \\nalso apparent. An explosive propagation of pests, particularly bark beetles and nun \\nmoths ( Lymantria monacha , a leave-eating butterfly, especially on spruce and pine), \\nwas a consequence of high temperatures and decreased vitality of forests in 2003 \\n(BMVEL, 2003). \\nIn Germany in the year of the heat wave, the area of burnt forest was also by 25% \\nlarger than the average across 1991-2002, namely 1315 ha. In 1992 the largest area \\nof burnt forest since 1990 was registered, with 4908 ha and an estimated damage of 12.8 million €. In this “record summer” the absolute maximum air temperature \\nreached 39.1ºC, and the maximum of precipitation deficiency was in Northeast \\nGermany, where stand conditions and plantati on types (sandy soils, pine stands) in \\ngeneral cause maximum forest fire risk (Anders et al., 2004).  \\nAlmost every fire starts on the ground – it is therefore meaningful that since the last \\nfew decades undergrowth of grasses in forests is increasing and favouring two grass species that rank very highly on the scale of inflammabilty, namely wood small-reed \\n(Calamagrostis epigejos ) and wavy hair-grass ( Deschampsia flexuosa ). Furthermore, \\nthe grass layer contributes to increased evaporation and therefore to further desiccation. Reasons for increasing grass layer are thought to be on the one hand \\natmospheric nitrogen deposition and acidification, and on the other hand climate \\nwarming in combination with dryer summers. Therefore, dry summers increase the risk of forest fires not only in the year itself, but also in the following years (Anders et al., 2004). \\nMoreover, in recent decades, an increase in forest damages through storms was \\nobserved. Particularly in Southern Germany, the low-pressure systems “Vivian”, \\n“Wiebke” (1990) and “Lothar” (1999) caused disastrous damages. \\nThe Forestry Sector and Climate Protection \\nPresently, German forests are a sink of carbon. Between 1987 and 2003, forests in Germany absorbed approximately 75 Mt CO\\n2, which corresponds to approximately 3% \\nof Germany’s CO 2-emissions during the same time (BMVEL, 2005). Therefore, the \\nprotection and maintenance of forests plays an important role in climate protection. \\nFurther Influences on the Forestry Sector in Germany \\nIn Germany, forests overwhelmingly are managed ecosystems. Management strategies (targeted tree species, rotation times, type of harvest) vitally determine the status of ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 90}), Document(page_content='- 92 -  \\n the forest and influence the processes within it. In their turn, management strategies \\ndepend strongly on the actual conditions of the wood market. Land use changes such as afforestation, and the building of roads and settlements are further direct influences. Besides these direct human influences, forests are indirectly impacted \\nthrough anthropogenic pollution (sulphur compounds, nitrogen, ozone) and changes in \\nthe water balance (melioration). Further influences are biotic factors such as pest insects and fungi, and the invasion by ne ophytes. Many of these factors interact. \\nClimate and weather extremes and the impacts of climate change act as additional \\nstressors in concert with these factors and often enhance their impacts (e.g. risk of calamities). \\n4.3.4  Impacts of Climate Change – Trends and Projections \\nYield Potential and Wood Increment \\nWe expect that the influence of climate change on yield potential will increase in \\nfuture. Of special importance are water supply and therefore precipitation and its seasonal patterns. Besides this, yield potential will continue to also depend strongly on the chosen management options (targete d tree species, type of management). \\nAn experts’ survey reached the conclusion, that under the assumption of a warming by \\n1-2ºC and an increase of precipitation by 0-20% in the next 60 years, productivity \\n(annual increment) could be increased by  5-20%, depending on tree species and \\nregion (Spiecker et al., 2000). Scenarios of the study “Forests and Forestry in Germany Under Global Change” (Pretzsch et al., 2002) project an increase of wood \\nproduction in Germany by 5% by the year 2030, using a relatively wet climate \\nscenario calculated by HadCm2. On the other hand, the relative dry climate scenario calculated by ECHAM4 projected a decrease in wood production by 9% (Döbbeler & Spellmann, 2002). \\nResults from the ATEAM project (see chap ter 2) show that Germany can expect a \\nfurther increase in stocks of wood and also carbon stocks in the next 100 years under \\nall scenarios (Fig. 4.3-2, Fig. 4.3-7 in the Annex). According to these scenarios, \\nGerman forest would continue to be a sink of carbon in future. However, this goes along with an aging of the forest stands, lowe r increments (Fig. 4.3-3, Fig. 4.3-8 in the \\nAnnex), and a higher susceptibility to weather extremes and calamities. Reasons for \\nthis trend are not so much climate changes,  but the present trend in management of \\nlow wood extraction. Accordingly, the results depend more upon different socio-economic conditions (SRES-Scenarios) than on different climate scenarios calculated \\nby different climate models. \\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080[%]\\n14.9 - 38.5 %\\n(∆23.6%)\\n36.5 - 38.5 %\\n(∆2.0%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n14.9 - 38.5 %\\n(∆23.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2Change in Stocks of Carb on in German Forests [%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080[%]\\n-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080-50 -25 02550\\n1990 2020 2050 2080[%]\\n14.9 - 38.5 %\\n(∆23.6%)\\n36.5 - 38.5 %\\n(∆2.0%)4 Models \\n(Scenario A2)Change  \\nby 2080\\n14.9 - 38.5 %\\n(∆23.6%)4 Scenarios\\n(HadCM3)\\nHadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2PCM–A2 HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B1HadCM3–B1\\nHadCM3–B2HadCM3–B2HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A1HadCM3–A1\\nHadCM3–A2HadCM3–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CGCM2–A2CGCM2–A2\\nCSIRO2–A2CSIRO2–A2PCM–A2PCM–A2Change in Stocks of Carb on in German Forests [%]\\n \\nFig. 4.3-2: Relative change (%) in stocks of carbon (above and belowground) of \\nGerman forests up to 2080 relative to baseline (1990) for seven ATEAM scenarios.

Here, stand conditions will shift towards oak-hornbeam ( Carpinus betulus )- and alternatively oak-pine-forests. \\nSpruce will also be particularly impacted. Spruce is adapted to moist and cool \\nenvironments, and its natural area of distri bution is limited to sub-alpine and high \\nmountainous locations in high and low mountain ranges. Presently spruce is however \\ngrown in wide areas of Southern and Western Germany in different environments. Here climate impacts will likely lead to yield losses, due among other things to drought stress and high temperatures (Flaig et al., 2003). \\nOn the other hand, changing environments may offer the opportunity to introduce new \\nspecies and to diversify the range of suitable species. In the alpine region it is for \\nexample expected that the altitudinal limi t of beech will incline and therefore the \\nproportion of mixed forests in this regions may increase.  \\nIf Mediterranean species will be able to migrate north is still a matter of debate. One \\nlimiting factor could be the soil conditions (e.g. soil pH) (VWF, 1994). \\nAltogether, it can be expected that the rate of climate change will exceed the rate at \\nwhich forests can adapt naturally. Therefore,  adapted species and cultivars should be a \\ntarget of facilitation. \\nPests and Pathogens \\nThe entire interrelations between climate change and pests and pathogens are not yet understood. However, it appears that particular ly pests of spruce (e.g. bark beetle) will \\nprofit from climate change (Flaig et al., 2003).  \\nRisk of Forest Fires \\nModel simulations of risk of forest fires for the federal states Baden-Württemberg and Brandenburg from 2000 to 2050 show a considerably increased risk for Brandenburg. Particularly the dry Southern part of this state is rated to be in the highest class of fire \\ndanger under the scenarios studied. In Baden- Württemberg, the risk of forest fires will \\nincrease only very moderately, owing to moister conditions and a different tree species composition.

Sample size: Telephone interviews in 13 federal states. \\nExperts rated most risks as “negative” or “very negative”, and the opportunities as \\n“positive” or “very positive”. Only two impa cts (reduced species diversity of forests and \\nchanged demands of other land users) are rated on average as “slightly negative”. \\nNone of the risk or opportunities of climate change were rated as insignificant (“neither \\npositive nor negative”). \\nRisk Assessment \\nThree risks were on average across federal states rated as “very negative”. These \\nwere more frequent or more intense storms  and longer periods of aridity  as direct \\nclimate impacts, and  increased susceptibility to usual pests as indirect climate impact. \\nThe greatest worry of experts was more frequent or more intense storms . All \\nrespondents rated this risk most frequently as “very negative”. Two main reasons seem to be responsible for this: First, experts observed an increase in storm damages in recent decades. Second, respondents stressed that storm threaten forests \\nimmediately and directly, and can pose an existential risk to forest enterprises. Wood \\nfrom storm-breaks enters the market unplanned and in large quantities, which leads to a strong decrease in prices. For example, in the months following the large storm \\nevents of the 1990s, wood prices sank by up  to 50%. Today, many state forests have \\nto be financially self-sustaining and therefore reach financial difficulties more easily. Small private forest owners are even more at risk, since they hardly own any financial \\nreserves to cope with such events. \\nLonger periods of aridity  also play an important role. All experts rate them as \\n“negative” at minimum; the majority even rated longer periods of aridity as “very \\nnegative”. In response to the open questions, a link to the dry summer of 2003 is made. This link and the strongly negative rating lead to the hypothesis that there is a connection between the freshness of recent ev ents and the degree of negativity in \\ntheir rating. Some experts identified the summer of 2003 as a reference value of sorts. \\nAn increasing frequency of hot summers is expected, therefore in its planning forestry should take the findings of the year 2003 into account.

The majority of experts rated this risk as “very negative”. They identify the various pest species. So me stress the damages caused by pathogenic \\nfungi, others focus on specific insect species. Mainly, respondents pointed to the \\nextreme propagation of pest species. The species have been known for a long time, \\nbut so far have played only a marginal role. Respondents often named favourable weather conditions, such as e.g. mild winters, as the trigger of this extreme \\npropagation. \\nThe majority of the assessed risks were rank ed on average over the 13 federal states \\nas “negative”. These risks were among others extreme periods of aridity, more \\nfrequent extreme rain events, and more prec ipitation as a direct impacts of climate \\nchange, as well as declining groundwater tables and invasion of new pest species as indirect impacts. \\nSome patterns appear when comparing the distribution of ratings across federal \\nstates. A distinct pattern appears when looking at the rating of the risk of more \\nfrequent extreme rainfall events . Extreme rainfall events increase the risk of floods. \\nMany respondents seem to be influenced in their ratings by their experience in recent \\nyears. Here especially the extreme rainfall events in the year 2002 play an important \\nrole. Particularly the abutting states of Elbe and Danube rated the issue of more \\nfrequent extreme rainfall events as “very negative”, since the floods particularly hit them. In this context, respondents named water retention in forests and the protection against soil erosion as special demands towards planning in forestry.  \\nA geographical pattern also became very apparent in the ratings of the risk of declining \\ngroundwater tables . This risk was rated on average as “negative” for natural and \\nplanted forest stands. But there were distinct differences in the ratings from different \\nfederal states. All respondents from Northern and Eastern states rated this impact as “very negative”, while experts from Southern and Western states mainly chose the \\ncategory “slightly negative”. \\nThe ratings of the risk of increasing precipitation  are also interesting. Again a \\ngeographical pattern appears. While Western and Southern federal states rated this \\nrisk mainly as “negative”, Eastern and Northern states ranked an increase of precipitation mainly as insignificant. \\nThere was a wide range of responses for the risks of invasion of new pest species  and \\nforest fires . However, no geographical pattern was found within these responses. \\nReplies on these issues exhibit a high degr ee of uncertainty about the probability of \\noccurrence and the severity of the threat. Furthermore, a causal connection between \\nclimate change and these issues is not seen as certain. For example, some respondents saw the increase of international trade as root cause of the threat of new \\npest species to forests. So-called “imported pests” are distributed through imported \\nproducts and means of transport worldwide, and can also infest German forests. \\nAssessment of Opportunities \\nThe increased yield potential of forests  is seen as an opportunity. This issue was on \\naverage rated as “positive”. Respondents from  Eastern Germany saw this issue as less \\nimportant than respondents from the West, some experts from Western Germany even rated this issue as “very positive”. An increase in yield potential is mainly expected in \\nthe short-term, in the long-term climate chan ge could even decrease yield potential. \\nMoreover, experts stress that an increase in potential will not necessarily lead to an increase in actual yield. As a reason for this the relatively low demand for wood was named among other things. \\nAnother opportunity of climate change lies in the widened range of locations suitable to \\nforestry. Shifting climatic zones can offer the opportunity to newly use specific \\nlocations or to improve their usage. This  issue is rated on average as “slightly \\npositive”. In four federal states respondents chose the rank “positive”, in six states “neither positive nor negative” was chosen. Some experts described programmes that \\nare specifically targeted at the afforestation of areas at the limit of suitable arable soil ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 95}), Document(page_content='- 97 -  \\n conditions. Such soils were previously used for agriculture, but are barely viable. The \\nprogrammes support a shift of the usage of these soils to forestry with fast growing trees, which can later be used for the prod uction of alternative, renewable energy \\nresources. The impacts of climate change can play a role in the selection of locations \\nfor such a conversion of use. \\nSome respondents stressed the importance of public interest  in the role of forests. The \\nrisks of climate change impacts on forestry could lead to increased public awareness of \\nthe issues dealt with in the forestry sector. Raised awareness is thought of as positive, it is believed to enliven the discussion on  the societal role of forests and their \\nfunctions, and could increase the appreciation of long-term planning in forestry. \\nRespondents drew comparisons to the public debate about “waldsterben” (forest dieback). Some respondents also stressed the role of forests as source of raw \\nmaterials . In the medium term, wood could be used as renewable energy source in \\nbiomass energy plants, especially with a su stained high supply of wood. This form of \\nusage is open to low quality wood, which previously is rather seen as an unavoidable side-product of high-quality wood prod uction. Therefore the focus of forestry \\nenterprises could shift in the medium term, not only quality matters, but also the \\nquantity of wood production gains in import ance. This could lead to changed plantation \\nand management methods, and might hold some negative consequences for the \\n“forests as ecosystems”.  \\n4.3.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nMeasures of forest conversion – increasing diversity : In the face of climate change \\nimpacts that hardly can be predicted for any specific forest stand, diverse forests with \\nnature-oriented species compositions and wide genetic amplitude are the best \\nprecondition for adaptive and therefore henceforth stable forest ecosystems (BMVEL, 2004). Currently programmes of forest conversion towards suitable species and mixed forests are underway. This is welcomed as the right management direction, since out-\\nof-natural-habitat tree species and monocultures often show a small range of tolerance \\nwith respect to long-tem changes and are more susceptible to stresses (pests, windbreak). However, potential impacts of climate change should be considered when \\nselecting target species. In critical areas (sandy soils, current insufficient water supply) \\nthe plantation of drought-tolerant or frugal tree species should be encouraged. For example, the conversion of pure coniferous  forest stands by introducing beech trees \\nshould not take place at locations that are already presently at the limit of beech \\ndistribution with regard to their moisture balance (BMVEL, 2004). On such locations, oak-hornbeam plantations are an example of a possible alternative. The conversion of \\nout-of-habitat pure spruce stands is of special importance. At such unsuitable \\nlocations, spruce has proven to be particularly sensitive to the direct (water deficiency) \\nand indirect (pest infestation) impacts of climate change (Feemers et al., 2003).  \\nIncreasing Genetic Diversity : Besides enhancing species diversity, increasing genetic \\ndiversity plays an important role. To guar antee the modification of physiological \\nprocesses on the individual level, as well as to allow adaptation on the population \\nlevel, genetic diversity should reflect an extent that corresponds to the specific location \\n(Anders et al., 2004). Adaptation on the genetic level includes favouring trees from well-adapted, e.g. drought-tolerant populations.  \\nPlantation of Non-Native Tree Species : It is currently a matter of controversial debate \\nif non-native species that are well-adapted to the impacts of climate change (e.g. Douglas fir) should be increasingly used.  \\nManagement Strategies : Only about 70% of the annual increment is harvested in \\nGerman forests. This goes along with an aging of the stands, a decrease in biomass \\nincrement, and a decrease in carbon absorption. Harvesting wood sustainably and in \\nalignment with wood increment is therefore an important contribution to the protection of our forests. Rejuvenation of stands on the one hand leads to an increased \\nadaptability of (young) individual trees,  and on the other hand promotes natural \\nselection toward climate-adapted populations. The Federal Government supports an increased demand for wood by 20% within the next 10 years with its “Charter for Wood” (BMVEL, 2005). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 96}), Document(page_content='- 98 -  \\n Increased Prevention of Forest Fires : Such measures include mainly improved forest \\nfire early warning systems via video surveillance or satellite-based systems, a better integration of planning levels (forest owners, communities, regional authorities, forestry departments, fire brigades, road constructions), and improvements in \\ntechnical infrastructure. Moreover, a conversion to mixed forests, which usually exhibit \\na moister forest internal climate, decreases the risk of forest fires (Badeck et al., 2004b). \\nChanges in Water Management Plans : This refers to measures that counteract an \\nadditional decrease in water supply, mainly through declining groundwater tables. \\nExamples for this are the re-wetting of floodplain forests and the deactivation of \\nmelioration systems (draining systems).  \\nReducing Additional Threats : This mainly includes the further decrease of pollution, the \\nmaintenance of soil fertility (mainly protective lining of soils, minimising soil \\ncompaction), as well as avoidance of the disturbance of sensitive forest ecosystems, e.g. through decreased traffic. \\nImproved Risk Management : In general, consistent risk management of forestry \\nenterprises should gain importance and be supported, e.g. through training courses. \\nThis includes the identification, prevention and defence against risks, as well as the \\nmanagement of damages. \\n4.3.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nThe survey of regional experts from fo restry departments of 13 German federal \\nstates16 concerned not only the rating of potential climate impacts (section 4.3.5), but \\nalso adaptation measures that are suitable to adapt to climate change. The survey \\nincluded five categories of measures. Respondents rated these measures with regard to their degree of implementation (see Fig. 4.3-6), as well as obstacles and complexity \\nof implementation. Additionally we interv iewed a scientific expert on the forestry \\nsector, to assess the effectiveness of the measures regarding the avoidance of potential risks (see section 4.3.5) and the ex ploitation of potential opportunities of \\nclimate change (see Tab. 4-3). \\n                                              \\n \\n16 In the federal states Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin no surveys were conducted for \\nthe forestry sector.

On the one hand, there are activities that, according to \\nrespondents, were started as direct responses to projections or experiences of climate change. This applies particularly to measur es that were planned or implemented in \\nrecent years. On the other hand, experts describe activities that have been practice \\nsince a longer time. Their implementation was not motivated by climate change, however, these measures are still suitable to adapt to climate change. For example, in some Western states conversion programmes towards mixed forests have been going \\non since over 20 years. Other issues motivated these programmes, but nevertheless \\nthey decrease the sensitivity to climate impacts. \\nPlantation of Drought-tolerant or Frugal Species \\nThe first category of measures comprises the increased plantation of drought-tolerant \\nor frugal species  (e.g. oak, hornbeam, and basswood ( Tilia spec.) in Brandenburg, \\nalternatively pine and Douglas fir in Bavaria). These plantations may be effective \\nmeasures against the risks of longer or more extreme periods of drought, declining \\ngroundwater tables, and of reduced species diversity, and may be suitable for a wider range of locations that are open to forestry use (see Tab. 4-3). \\nAccording to respondents, such measur es are on average already “partially \\nimplemented” (see Fig. 4.3-6). In eight out of 13 federal states the plantation of \\ndrought-tolerant or frugal species was rated as already “partially implemented” or \\n“implemented”. In the remaining five states, such measures are not yet planned, but \\ncurrently debated at best. \\nMany respondents state that assumptions about forest growth from the past do not \\nanymore match current observations. This is attributed not only to climate change. Therefore a revision of stand monitoring is planned. The results of this new monitoring point to adapted suggestions concerning the planting of trees, which could stress the \\ncultivation of drought-tolerant species. However, the introduction of such species can \\nvary strongly with region. It was considered more important to align new plantations with average conditions at a specific, local stand. \\nSuch respondents that document the degree of implementation of the plantation of \\ndrought-tolerant or frugal species as low, particularly identify the uncertainty of future \\nperiods of drought as an important obstac le. These respondents rather planted mixed \\nstands, to be able to react flexibly to the uncertain impacts of climate change. With regards to these obstacles, the plantation of drought-tolerant or frugal species is rated \\non average as a “complicated” measure. \\nConversion or Rejuvenation to Mixed Forests \\nA second category of adaptation measures is concerned with the conversion or \\nrejuvenation of forests to mixed forests . We use the term mixed forest in a wider \\nsense, referring to a high diversity of tree species, as well as to a high structural \\ndiversity of the forest (age, size etc.). The conversion to mixed forests, as well as the maintenance of genetic diversity is of very broad effectiveness in relation to other \\nmeasures (see Tab. 4-3). It is therefore a highly advisable strategy with regard to \\nenhanced adaptability to various, uncertain risks of climate change. Experts from forestry departments rank the conversion to mixed forests as an important measure. \\nOn average, respondents rated the degree of implementation of the conversion to \\nmixed forests with “implemented” as higher than that of any other measure (see Fig. \\n                                                                                                                             \\n \\nthe values between the lower and the upper quartile. The more to the left the box is \\nshown, the more negative a specific impact of climate change is rated. The thick \\nvertical line represents the median value. Th e whiskers to the left and right of the box \\nillustrate the range of responses. The n-values give the number of valid answers each box-plot is based on. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 99}), Document(page_content='- 101 -  \\n 4.3-6). In almost all federal states, the conversion of forests to mixed forests is \\nalready being “implemented” or is “partially implemented”. Due to long conversion times, the conversion of forests will only be completed in a few decades. However, the political decision for the principle conversion of forests has already been made in most \\nfederal states. The time of the first implemen tation of such measures was much earlier \\nin Western than in Eastern states. Therefor e, the conversion of forests is rated as \\nfurther advanced in Western states. \\nThe majority of respondents does not name adaptation to climate change as the main \\nreason to convert the forests. This is much more a host of measures that were \\ndesigned to tackle a range of challenges. Two reasons that were identified most \\nfrequently are the diffusion of risks and the orientation to potential natural vegetation. The diffusion of risks through mixed forests is seen as insurance in the face of various risks that are difficult to calculate. Climate change is only one of a range of risks. \\nForests are meant to gain general stability in comparison to classic monocultures. \\nHedging economic risks also  plays an important role. \\nResponses regarding the complexity and the obstacles of forest conversions are \\ncontradicting. Some experts classify the introduction of mixed forests as “complicated” and reduce their expected profits accordingl y. Others stress the profitability of mixed \\nforests. All respondents stress that the conversion of the entire state forests is a \\nprocess of multiple decades. Short-term risks will not be mitigated by such measures. \\nIncreasing and Maintaining Genetic Diversity \\nA third category of measures we enquired about is the increase and maintenance of \\ngenetic diversity . Under this category we summarise any practical measure that \\nconserves genetic diversity. Examples for this are using seedlings from different origins, monitoring and conserving specific sub-species, and the creation of genetic \\ndatabases. As mentioned before, the conser vation of genetic diversity is of broad \\neffectiveness (see Tab. 4-3), just as the conversion to mixed forests, and therefore also is an advisable strategy to enhance broad adaptive capacity of the forestry sector.  \\nOn average, this measure was rated as alre ady “partially implemented” (see Fig. 4.3-\\n6). The vast majority of respondents reported on initiatives to maintain genetic diversity. Only few respondents reported this measure as already “implemented”. A \\nGermany-wide programme for the conservation of forest gene resources from the \\n1980s is named as the initial spark for such measures. This programme created the first forest gene banks. \\nThe widening of the ecological amplitude of specific species is seen as the main \\nobjective of this adaptation measure. Species shall become increasingly robust to \\nenvironmental influences. Another reason to implement such measures concern the \\nprotection of nature (e.g. the conservation of specific sub-species). \\nRespondents identified as the largest obstacles the limited financial and organisational \\nresources of the federal states. Many experts also desired better coordination and \\nnetworking between federal states. On average, however, the increase and maintenance of genetic diversity was rated only as “slightly complicated”. \\nPrevention of Forest Fires  \\nThis category refers to any measures to prevent forest fires, for example the further development of technologies for early warning systems and fire fighting, plans of \\nalarm, measures in forest management, and public education. The measures should on \\nthe one hand prevent the occurrence of fires, and on the other hand reduce the extent of damages through fires. In this context, the prevention of forest fires is also an effective measure with regard to longer or more extreme periods of aridity (see Tab. \\n4-3). \\nOn average across the 13 federal states, prevention of forest fires was rated as \\nalready “partially implemented” – however, there were very large differences between \\nspecific federal states (see Fig. 4.3-6). In nine out of 13 states, this measure was ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 100}), Document(page_content='- 102 -  \\n rated as already “implemented”, some even since some time. Most states stress that \\npreventive measures are already established. Forest fires have been seen as an important risk for a log time, and the technical measures in place are rated as sufficient. Adaptation therefore currently concerns only the improvement of systems \\nthat are already in place. Some experts use the period of extreme drought of 2003 as \\na reference value, i.e. they expect an increasing frequency of similar events in future. The planning of adaptation measures is adapted accordingly.  \\nAn important trend in recent years took place in technological development. The \\nsurveillance of forests by video- and infrared-techniques, as well as the increasing \\ndistribution of mobile phones facilitates detection of and warning about fires already in \\nthe early stage. Eastern German states are more active with regard to early warning technologies. This may be due to a relatively wide distribution of coniferous monocultures, which are particularly susceptible to fire. Measures to detect and fight \\nforest fires were dominant. Only one respondent explicitly named forest management \\nmeasures as means of preventing fires. The other respondents did not go into such special prevention strategies, apart from the general benefits of introducing mixed \\nforests.  \\nThe average and the majority of respondent s rated prevention of forest fires as \\n“complicated”. Many experts saw the coordination with other actors of forest fire \\nfighting as a key issue (e.g. community admi nistration, local fire fighters, technical \\nrelief organisation). In this regard, the clarification of responsibilities and the creation and updating of plans of action play an important role. In general, it is seen as \\ninadequate to finance such measures from the budget of the forestry department \\nalone, since the protection against fire lies in the interest of other actors as well. Therefore some experts stress the public good such adaptation measures contribute to \\nand the need for support from states and communities. \\nWater Supply and Management \\nAs a last category of measures to adapt to climate change, we asked about activities \\nwith regard to water supply and management , in order to prevent future water \\nshortages in the forests. Systematic management of surface and groundwater is seen \\nas an effective response to potential climate impacts such as longer and more extreme periods of aridity, increased precipitation, declining groundwater tables, increased risk \\nof forest fires, and the possibly exacerbated conflicts of usage within the forestry \\nsector, as well as with actors in other sectors (e.g. agriculture, producing industry, local waterworks) (see Tab. 4-3). Concepts for systematic water resource \\nmanagement have the primary goal to prev ent, mitigate or even avoid conflicts \\nbetween different groups of interest.  \\nEight out of 13 respondents reported that such measures are currently considered or \\nbeing planned. On average, concepts of water management were rated as “currently considered” (see Fig. 4.3-6). Obviously, this measure is not as far along towards implementation compared to other measures. The complexity of the measure does, \\nhowever, not seem to lie beyond that of other measures. Concepts of water \\nm a n a g e m e n t  w e r e  s e e n  a s  “ c o m p l i c a t e d ”  b y  t h e  m a j o r i t y  o f  r e s p o n d e n t s .  S o m e  experts remarked that water management could become a “politically sensitive topic” \\nmore quickly than other measures. From the viewpoint of forestry departments alone, \\nwater management concepts seem only of limited complexity. However, the diverging \\ninterests of other users, such as agriculture and waterworks, increase the complexity \\nof the issue in a political sense. \\nFurther Measures \\nRespondents did not name any qualitatively new measures when asked for further \\nmeasures within the forestry sector that would be suitable to adapt to risk of climate \\nchange and capitalize on its potential opportunities. We see this as evidence, that the \\ncategories of measures surveyed he re were relatively comprehensive. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Forestry Departments ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 101}), Document(page_content='- 103 -  \\n All experts involved in the survey were fr om forestry departments of federal states. \\nThe results of the survey show that within the forestry departments of the 13 surveyed \\nfederal states there is an ongoing debate on the impacts of climate change. Eight out \\nof 13 respondents rated the degree of relevance of the subject of adaptation to climate \\nchange in their departments  in comparison to other topics as “important”. None of the \\ndepartments sees the topic as “unimportant”. In the forest departments of the North-western federal states North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, and Schleswig-Holstein \\nadaptation to climate change was rated as “slightly important”, in Baden-Württemberg \\nand Saxony as “very important”. The adaptation to climate change therefore has a relatively high relevance in the forestry departments of most federal states, especially in comparison to the other climate-sensitive sectors that were surveyed here. \\nIn comparison, other topics are even more relevant than adaptation to climate change. \\nFor forestry departments especially the topics reform of the administration and \\ndevelopment of wood prices are of utmost importance. All respondents rated these \\nissues uniformly as very important. It seems that day-to-day management issues push aside long-term strategic decisions. \\nWhen asked what triggers the debate about adaptation to climate change  in the \\nforestry departments, the majority of respondents pointed to experiences with \\nextreme weather events. Especially storm events were listed. In this respect, the years \\n1990 and 1994 are mentioned in particular. In these years extraordinarily high storm damages were recorded. Further triggers of damages are extreme weather conditions. Respondents named especially strong pest infestations, caused by extreme summers \\nor mild winters.  \\nSome experts stressed the need to integrate their activities in the larger political \\nactivities  of the state government. The objective here is a general, sector-encroaching \\nadaptation. The same respondents who stress this integration of their activities related more often than others to studies that assess the impacts of climate change on a \\nregional scale. They deduct demands on the planning of forest management from the \\nresults of such regional studies. Specific forestry studies are another basic resource for planning in forestry. These studies directly relate to the activities within the forestry sector and are mostly based on retrospective, empirical data. All in all, seven of the 13 \\nstate representatives related their answers explicitly to results of scientific studies – in \\ncomparison to other surveyed sectors (particularly the transport sector etc.) this is evidence of a high degree of knowledge concerning climate change. \\nAdaptation in the Forestry Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nThe conversion to mixed forests, and the ma intenance of genetic diversity were seen \\nas most broadly effective measures to mitigate potential risks and capitalize on \\npotential benefits of climate change in comparison to other adaptation measures. \\nTherefore these measures are particularly advisable strategies to promote broad adaptive capacity to various, uncertain risks and opportunities of climate change. We also wish to stress that there does not seem to be single potential impact of climate \\nchange on forestry that could not be met at least with one suitable adaptation \\nmeasure. Most measures that are suitable to adapt to climate change in Germany are however, not yet fully, but “only” partially implemented. Solely the implementation of \\nimproved water management concepts is currently only in an early stage. The \\nimplementation of most measures was rated as “complicated”, indicating that full implementation will not be achieved withou t difficulties, and that special support may \\nbe necessary.  \\nPotential impacts of climate change have already been accounted for in the planning of \\nsome measures. Relative to other sectors that were surveyed (particularly the \\ntransport sector), there seems to be an in tensive debate on climate change and its \\nimpacts on the forestry sector. In this sense, the forestry sector can serve as a role model for other sectors. However, also for the forestry sector we doubt that the \\ncurrently implemented and planned measures wi ll be sufficient to confront the impacts \\nof climate change; the debate about climate change in the forestry department is in its early stage, for many forest owners this debate seems not yet to have begun. This ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 102}), Document(page_content='- 104 -  \\n means: the forestry sector is probably not adapted to climate change in most federal \\nstates. \\nHowever, in general the forestry sector should have a high capacity to adapt in future \\nto impacts of climate change; a range of effective adaptation options is available, \\nmany of which are already being implemented. Moreover, the central actors in the forestry sector – forestry departments of the federal states – have a high level of \\nknowledge concerning potential impacts of climate change and rank adaptation to \\nclimate change highly on their agenda. Decisi ve elements in the adaptive capacity of \\nthe forestry sector are the development of  the economic context (wood market), the \\neconomic pressure on individual forest owners, the opportunity to coordinate \\ndecisions, and the perception of risks an d opportunities of climate change and the \\nconsequent willingness to adapt. In this re gard, private forestry may be particularly \\nvulnerable. But economic pressure also grow s on forests owned by states or corporate \\nbodies.

In the \\nlong term, species that are of limited migration potential, as well as species whose \\nmigration is hindered by geographical obstacles (mountains, water bodies) or lacking \\nconnection between habitats are threatened by extinction. Particularly impacted are \\nrare species (species on the Red List), species with a narrow ecological range of \\ntolerance, as well as cold- and moisture-loving (hygrophile) species.  \\nShifts in potential species distribution have a profound influence on the number of \\nspecies and the species composition of communities and habitats. In the long term, \\nthe composition of existing communities will change, and new communities may form. \\n“Azonal biotopes” on special locations are particularly impacted, such as wetlands, but \\nalso montane shrubs, and vegetation communities on rock or stone. \\nRegionally, the Alpine area is particularly impacted, because of its abundance of \\nendemic plants and animals, many azonal biotopes and unique climatic locations. \\nIn the medium to long term, changes in species composition and communities in \\nGermany cannot be avoided. Adaptation measures should primarily seek to maintain \\nand promote natural adaptive potential. This includes measures to enable migration \\n(e.g. connecting habitats) and flexible concepts of protection. Wetlands require special \\nprotection (e.g. through alterations in water management). \\nAs part of the European coordination of nature conservation efforts (e.g. NATURA \\n2000) and additional national initiatives, many of these adaptation measures have \\nalready been introduced and some have al ready been fully implemented. However, \\nonly in a few cases this is in direct response to climate change. Therefore, monitoring \\nof climate change impacts on biodiversity and climate change related trends should \\nreceive more attention in nature conservation in future. \\nThere are a number of further factors that impact biodiversity and nature conservation \\nnegatively at present and in future, namely land use changes, such as e.g. \\ndisturbance, fragmentation and destruction of habitats through development, \\ntransport, agriculture and forestry, as well as replacement of native species by \\ninvasive species, some of which profit from climate change. \\nThe assessment of the vulnerability of the na ture conservation sector is difficult, \\nbecause it depends to a large extent on the ob jectives of the protection of biodiversity. \\nVulnerability with and without further adaptation needs to be rated as “high” if the \\nconservation of present level species richness is the goal. Even if changing species \\ncompositions are accepted, vulnerability without further adaptation will still be \\n“moderate” to “high” (business-as-usual scenario, see chapter 2.8). The processes \\nbrought about by anthropogenic climate change will most probably exceed the \\nadaptation potential of many biological systems and will therefore threaten the \\ndiversity and stability of species, habitats and ecosystems in general. A reduction of \\nvulnerability to “moderate” levels should be possible if adaptation options are \\nimplemented through nature conservation management – this will in any case require \\nspecial public and governmental support (improved-business scenario, see chapter \\n2.8).

It includes the \\ndiversity within species (genetic diversity), between species (species diversity) and the \\ndiversity of ecosystems (Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992). \\nBiodiversity is not an ecosystem service in the purest sense (see chapter 1.3), but is \\nthe basis of many other ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Biodiversity describes the elements of a landscape, its species, communities and ecosystems and determines many supporting and regulating services, such as e.g. \\nthe maintenance and functioning the oxyg en, nitrogen and carbon cycles, soil \\nformation, pollination, and the regulation and filtering of surface waters. Furthermore, biodiversity determines many provisioning ecosystem services, such as the production \\nof food, raw materials, water and genetic resources for pharmaceutical and medical \\nuses. Finally, biodiversity is the basis of cultural ecosystem services, such as the recreational value of a landscape or the cultural identity of a region (SCBD, 2003). \\nBesides this significance for ecosystem services, biodiversity contains a cultural and \\nsocietal value per se , which is expressed in the need to protect and conserve biological \\ndiversity. The protection and conservation of biodiversity is manifested as important goal in the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BnatSchG §2). \\nClimate determines in interaction with many other factors, such as soil type, \\nhydrology, landscape structure, and anthro pogenic interference biodiversity on all \\nlevels (genes, species, ecosystems). In the course of evolution, genotypes adapted to \\na specific climate of one species have developed. This genetic diversity contributes to ecosystem stability and flexibility, and ensures a selection of well-adapted varieties in \\nagriculture and forestry. \\nOn species level, climate directly influences physiology and metabolism. \\nPhotosynthesis and other metabolic processes in plants are strongly influenced by \\nradiation, temperature and water availability. Moreover, the CO\\n2-content of the \\natmosphere plays an important role (see chapter 4.2). Animals are mainly influenced by the temperature regime (optimal temperature, resistance to cold and frost). Here, \\ntemperature mainly influences metabolic physiology (e.g. frequency of breath) \\n(Leuschner & Schipka, 2004). Climate and weather conditions also directly determine the temporal occurrence of different processes of life and characteristic phases in the \\nannual and lifetime cycles of a species. In pl ants these include the various phonological \\nphases (bud break, flowering, maturation of fruits etc.), in animals the phenomena of reproduction, individual development, periods of activity and rest, as well as migratory \\nbehaviour.  \\nClimate influences biodiversity indirectly, through the amount and type of available \\nfood, soil conditions and other features of the habitat. These parameters have a strong \\ninfluence on the number of individuals (a bundance) of plant and animal species. \\nRegarding the amount of these interdependencies, climate is a decisive factor for the \\npotential distribution of a specific species. The area of climatic conditions under which \\na species can potentially occur (e.g. mini mum and maximum temperature) is called \\n“climatic envelope”, and will primarily earmark a species’ distribution. \\nClimatic suitability for specific species directly influences the composition of species \\ncommunities. Moreover, climate influences the conditions for symbiosis and \\ncompetition within and between different communities. In addition to that, climate \\ninfluences ecosystems directly and indirectly, e.g. through changing the water and nutrient balance, or through impacts of extreme events. \\nFurther Factors \\nIn Germany, the type of land use and the intensity of use play an important role for biodiversity. Habitat disturbance, fragmentation and destruction, e.g. through agriculture, forestry, development and tran sport, are seen as the main threats to \\nspecies in Germany. Pollution from agriculture and industry is another important \\nstressor.

Such species ca n be brought to Germany e.g. through the \\ntransport of goods or people, and may expand rapidly replacing native species, owing, among other things, to the lack of competitors. Invasive species are often \\nthermophilic, and may be better adapted to global warming than native species. \\nBiodiversity and Climate Protection  \\nThrough the type of land cover in a region, biodiversity influences various climatic factors, such as e.g. the energy and water balance or gas flux to the atmosphere, \\nleading to an influence on the local, regional and global climate (SCBD, 2003). The carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere is of particular importance (see chapter 3.3), since the biosphere can contribute to a decrease in the CO\\n2-concentration of the \\natmosphere by a net uptake of carbon, for example through forests and moors. \\nMeasures to increase the net carbon uptake of the biosphere, such as afforestation as \\nconsidered in the Kyoto protocol, can contribute to climate protection. On the other \\nhand, such measures can conflict with the protection of biodiversity, for example when species are planted out of their natural habitat (Herold et al. 2001). \\n4.4.3  Baseline situation: Biod iversity and Nature \\nConservation in Germany \\nSo far, 28,000 plant and fungi species have been found in Germany, among which are \\n3,242 flowering plants. Insects are, with 33,305 species, the largest group among the \\napproximately 48,000 animal species occurring in Germany. There are 706 species of vertebrates in Germany, the species richest among which are teleost fishes and birds. \\nWith 91 species, mammals are only a small group among vertebrates (Völkl, 2004). \\nThe population of many of these species are currently under threat. Among monitored \\nplants, 28.7% are threatened and 3.7% have already gone extinct. Among animals, \\ne.g. 71% of amphibian and reptile species, 37% of bird species, and 38% of mammal species are threatened. Six percent of bird species and 13% of mammals have already \\ngone extinct (BFN, 2004). Among the approx imately 500 types pf biotopes over two \\nthirds (69%) are ranked as threatened.  \\nOn the other hand, for some species, especially birds, but also some bat species, a \\npositive population development is observed (e.g. Montagu’s harrier ( Circus pygargus ), \\nquail ( Coturnix coturnix ), Alpine swift ( Apus melba )). These are the effects of current \\nprotection schemes, such as the Guidelines for Fauna and Flora Habitats (Fauna-Flora-\\nHabitat-Richtlinie, FFH), which was implemented in 1992, and measures for \\nextensification of agriculture. The cohe rent network of NATURA 2000 includes the \\nareas registered under FFH and guidelines for bird protection, which cover \\napproximately 13% of German land area (BFN, 2005).  \\nChanges in species composition, which are linked to climate change, have already \\nbeen observed in Germany and Central Europe. Thermophilic animal and plant species, \\nmostly sub-Mediterranean, Mediterranean, Atla ntic, but also sub-tropical and tropical \\nspecies immigrate or expand their limits of distribution towards North and East. Today, \\nthe scarlet darter (the dragonfly Crocothemis erythraea ), which was first sighted in \\nGermany in 1918, is found in the Upper Rhine Valley, in North Rhine-Westphalia, \\nNorthern Hesse, Northern Bavaria and Saxony. Also the redistribution of the praying mantis (Mantidae) in Southern Germany is thought to be linked to climate change. On \\naverage, a study of 99 species (birds, butterflies, Alpine plants) showed a shift in \\nspecies distribution per decade of 6.1 km North or 6.1 m up in altitude respectively (BFN, 2004).  \\nWarmer spring temperatures and longer summers have lengthened the vegetation \\nperiod of many tree species from Central Europe by on average 10 days since the 1950s (Menzel, 1997). Milder winters are one of the main factors explaining why many \\nbirds have given up (black redstart ( Phoenicurus ochrurus ), firecrest ( Regulus \\nignicapilla ), goldfinch ( Carduelis carduelis )) or altered (earlier arrival, later migration) \\ntheir migratory behaviour (BFN, 2004).

This surpasses the maximum speed of migration (approximately 20 to 200 km per century) of many species. Moreov er, migration is hindered by the lack of \\nsuitable habitats. \\nFurthermore, continued changes in phenolog y in the form of elongated vegetation \\nperiods are expected (SCBD, 2003). This can lead to an increase of yields for plants, \\nbut goes along with a higher susceptibility to late frost and infestation with pests (see \\nchapter 4.2). \\nIn general, further threats to species and extinctions due to climate change are \\nexpected in Southern and Central Europe. Model simulations by Bakkenes et al. (2002) and Thomas et al. (2004) project an extincti on of 10-30% of present species owing to \\nclimate change in Central Europe. In Germany between 5-30% of the present animal \\nand plant species could be affected (Leuschner & Schipka, 2004). \\nThe “worst case” scenario HadCM3 A1f (highest greenhouse gas concentration) of the \\nscenarios from the project ATEAM (see chapter 2) shows a possible loss of species in \\nGermany by the year 2080 ranging from 25% (North-western Germany) to over 50% (Southern and Eastern Germany) per grid cell (average loss per grid cell of 10’ x 10’ in \\n%, under the assumption of no migration) (Schröter et al., 2004, Schröter et al. \\n2005). \\nWhen taking into account potentially new species, which immigrate from the South \\nleads to a different picture (net balance of emigrating or lost species versus immigrating species): The number of species per grid cell of herbaceous plants in Germany decreases by 4-14% by 2080, depending on the emission scenario (Fig. 4.4-\\n2 in the Annex). Especially strong declines  o f  u p  t o  – 3 6 %  a r e  f o u n d  i n  t h e  A l p i n e  \\nregion and in South-western Germany.  \\nTrees show little sensitivity up to the year 205 0, but then exhibit a distinct increase in \\ntree species diversity up to the year 2080 under all scenarios except A1, particularly in Northern Germany (Fig. 4.4-3 in the Annex). Under the A1-scenario parts of Eastern \\nGermany and Western Germany show a decline in tree species richness. \\nAmphibians and reptiles exhibit an increase in species richness per grid cell until 2050 \\nby approximately 10%, followed by a decline to previous levels by 2080 (Fig. 4.4-4 in \\nthe Annex). The reason for this is that under a moderate increase in temperature \\ncurrent and new species from the South coul d co-exist. If temperature rises further, \\nconditions for current species deteriorate rapidly. \\nBirds do not exhibit any considerable changes under this statistical analysis (Fig. 4.4-5 \\nin the Annex). However, we have to expect that changes in landscapes affecting \\nresting and nesting places will nevertheless have a negative impact on populations. \\nThis could however not be simulated by the underlying modelling method (at the resolution of the analysis, land use chan ge effects were confounded with climate \\neffects). \\nSpecies Communities and Ecosystems \\nSpecies and ecosystems that have a narrow tolerance of temperatures and very \\nspecific demands on habitats are particularly threatened (SCBD, 2003). This could be \\nespecially true for ecosystems with a high proportion of species on the red list, which \\noften occur at small, climatically extraordinary locations (Leuschner & Schipka, 2004). Also ecosystems including long-lived plants (e.g. forests) are particularly endangered. \\nOwing to their relatively long reaction times they are fairly well buffered against short-\\nterm changes, but of limited adaptive potential in the long-term. Sensible phenological phases of such plants, such as e.g. th e maturation of seeds, are particularly \\nthreatened (SCBD, 2003). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 111}), Document(page_content='- 113 -  \\n Many climate change impact studies show that climate change can affect specific \\nspecies within a community very differently.  For example, the distribution of species \\nwithin the same community can change in diverging ways. This can lead to the decoupling of food webs and the break-up of  symbiotic relations between species. It \\nmust therefore be expected, that old communities will be dissolved and new \\nconnections between species in different “climatic envelopes” will develop. \\nLocation with microclimatic-hydrologic extraordinary conditions, such as e.g. wetlands \\nor montane brush, rock and stone vegetations, could offer a short-term buffer against changing climatic conditions (Leuschner & Schipka, 2004). At the same time, such \\necosystems are particularly endangered in the medium- and long-term, since their \\nspecies are usually tightly linked to the micro-climatic-hydrologic extraordinary conditions and will not be able to migrate elsewhere if these locations are not part of a wider network (Wittig & Nawrath, 2000). \\nIn the medium- to long-term, wetlands and moors are also particularly impacted \\nthrough decreasing summer precipitation and changes in flooding patterns. This \\nendangers not only the moisture dependant plant communities of wetlands, but also \\nthe species rich bird communities, such as inhabit for example large floodplain areas in Eastern Germany. Wittig and Nawrath (2004) rate plant communities at moist \\nlocations (lean marshes, Carex  spec. communities, wet meadows and forests, moors) \\nas particularly threatened by climate change. Rising sea levels and increased storm activity endanger freshwater marshes are at the coasts (SCBD, 2003). \\nEcosystems of the Alps are also particularly impacted. In the Alps, relief, soil and \\nclimate vary greatly and on a small scale , supporting a mosaic of highly diverse \\nhabitats and biotopes. The Alps are home to approximately 30,000 animal and 13,000 \\nplant species, approximately 39% of the Euro pean angiosperm flora. About 15% of the \\n2,500 plants growing above the tree line are endemic (Grabherr, 1998). Alpine plants are particularly sensitive to climate change, owing to their narrow ecological tolerance \\nand the lack of migration options (alterna tive habitats are lacking). Additionally, \\nspecies migrating from lower areas will increase the pressure. Such species may increase species diversity of Alpine regions in the short-term, but will lead to extinctions of endemic species in the long-term (EEA, 2004). \\nOther negative impacts on ecosystems and biological diversity will be the increased \\nexpansion of pests through milder winters, mo re frequent forest fi res (due to increased \\ntemperatures and aridity in summer), as well as extreme rainfall events, floods and \\ndroughts. \\n4.4.5  Impacts of Climate Change – Assessment by Regional \\nExperts \\nAs described in chapter 2.6, we conducted expert surveys in various climate-sensitive \\nsectors, including the nature conservation sector. Sector-specific assessments of \\npotential elements and impacts of climate change are available for different environmental zones (see chapter 2.6) from the following four federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Brandenburg, and Saxony. Assessments of the \\nparticularly vulnerable Alpine region are not available. Positive ratings are regarded as \\nacknowledgments of opportunities, negative ratings as acknowledgments of risks. Due to the low rate of return of the questionnaires, we did not graphically illustrate the \\nresults of the survey. The assessment, whic h is discussed in the following, must be \\nseen as very preliminary due to various reasons. Only very few questionnaires were returned from the federal states, only one expert per federal state was approached, \\nand few respondents base their assessment on studies of past and future climate \\ndevelopment and its impacts. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nRespondents rated the significance of clim ate change for biodiversity on average \\nacross all environmental zones and federal states in recent times (1990 to today) as \\n“neither positive nor negative”. The ratings are almost identical for the different environmental zones and federal states. In the short (today to 2010) and medium ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 112}), Document(page_content='- 114 -  \\n term (2010 to 2020), climate changes was on average judged to be “slightly \\nnegative”, in specific environmental zones and federal states also as “slightly positive” or “negative”. Only two ratings are available for the long term (2020 to 2050), but both are “negative”. With a good deal of caution we conclude that generally \\nincreasingly negative impacts are anticipated in the nature conservation sector. \\nRisk Assessment \\nOn average, respondents rated various potential elements of climate change  as \\n“slightly negative” or more negative already in the short term. These include a \\ndecrease in annual precipitation18, stronger variations in precipitation, more frequent \\nextreme rainfall events, as well as heat waves and hot days. In the medium- and long-term, these ratings become increasingly negative. Increasing average annual and \\nsummer temperatures, which were rated as neutral in the short term, are also rated as \\n“negative” in the medium term. The decrease in the annual precipitation sum is seen as the most severe risk. \\nAmong the four surveyed potential impacts of climate change  on biodiversity, only the \\nchanges in landscape balance (including declining groundwater tables) were rated as a \\nrisk. The other impacts (see Opportunity Assessment) were rated as rather positive. \\nThis positive assessment is probably mainly a function of the small sample size. \\nOpportunity Assessment \\nSome elements of climate change  – increasing winter temperatures, less frost days \\nand the increase in the annual precipitation sum – were on average rated as “slightly \\npositive” or neutral to “slightly positive” in the short term. The medium- and long-term these elements were rated as increasingly positive. \\nThe majority of potential impacts of climate change  on biodiversity are on average \\nrated as “slightly positive” in the short-, medium-, and long-term. This applies to \\npossible changes of species and ecosystem diversity owing to shifting species \\ndistributions further North or up in altitude, changes in phenology of plants (bud break, flowering etc.), and in the behaviou r of animals (nesting time, bird migration \\netc.). The strongest positive ratings were given to changes in plant phenology.  \\nFurther Impacts \\nWe also asked for further possible impacts of climate change on biodiversity and nature conservation. Respondents listed the emigration and disappearance of species \\nthat are adapted to cool and moist conditions, the changes or the disappearance of \\ncool and moist ecosystems with long development times, as well as the immigration and expansion of thermophilic or heat-tolerant, drought-tolerant, nitrophile species and generalists. \\n4.4.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nThe environment responds dynamically to changes in conditions. Management \\nmeasures to protect and conserve biodiversity under changing climatic conditions will be especially successful if they facilita te and support this dynamic. Of special \\nimportance is the maintenance and improvement of migration options for species . \\nThese include measures to connect biotopes  on local, regional, national and trans-\\nnational scales. This task has been adopte d in the new version of the Federal Nature \\nConservation Act, which states that the federal states should dedicate at least 10% of \\ntheir land area to the connection of biotopes (BnatSchG §3). \\nWe have to rethink the concepts of protection in nature conservation, which is mainly \\nconcerned with small nature reserves. Due to climate change, targeted species in \\n                                              \\n \\n18 According to the present state of knowledge increases and decreases in annual \\nprecipitation are possible, depending on th e region. Therefore, both developments \\nwere offered to the respondents for rating.

Species \\nwith future suitable habitats that, due to a climate change induced shifts further North or up, do not overlap with current suitable habitats or species that are faced with \\nobstacles for migration, such as e.g. natural barriers (Alps, North sea, Baltic sea) \\ndeserve special attention. In these cases, planned species introductions are an option to think about. \\nConcepts for water balance management  are suitable to maintain or revive natural \\nwater logging, in order to protect wetlands, which are particularly threatened by \\nclimate change (see above). These include concepts to revive water logging and dams \\nthat are adapted to the needs of nature conservation. \\nIn general, nature conservation strategies should be complemented by concepts that \\ntarget the protection of processes within natural systems . The European cultural \\nlandscape is strongly influenced by human life style and management. Therefore characteristic dynamic changes within natural ecosystems over time and space are \\noften hindered or forestalled. However, to adapt to climate change, such dynamics are \\nvery important. Besides migration they include also e.g. succession, rejuvenation or fires. \\n4.4.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the expert survey (method described in chapter 2.6) on \\nmeasures that are suitable for climate change adaptation from the following six federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bran denburg, Saarland, Hesse, Thuringia, and \\nSaxony.

Given that respondents rated potential impacts rather positive, with the exception of changes in landscape balance, Tab. 4-4 shows mainly how respondents rated the effectiveness of me asures to capitalize on opportunities of \\nclimate change.

Sample size: 6 questionnaires from the federal states Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Brandenburg, Saarland, Thuringia, and Saxony. The n-values give the number of questionnaires each \\nbox-plot is based on.\\n19  \\nImprovement of Migration Options for Species \\nNearly all experts thought that the improvement of migration options for species is an \\neffective measure to respond to changes in species and ecosystem diversity and composition due to shifts in distribution No rthward and to higher altitudes (see Tab. 4-\\n4). Fewer respondents also saw an effectiven ess of this measure to react to potential \\nchanges in the behaviour of animals and in landscape balance. \\nRespondents rated this measure on average across the six surveyed federal states as \\n“planned” (see Fig. 4.4-1). However, there were distinct differences between federal states. The highest rating (“partially implemented”) was reported from Brandenburg, \\nand Schleswig-Holstein. None of the respondents gave climate change as a reason to \\nimplement this measure, but among other things the realisation of legal guidelines, general nature conservation goals, state-wide planning of biotope and network \\nplanning, as well as the conservation of populations were listed. \\nTwo respondents named organisational hurdles as obstacles, one financial hurdles, \\nanother lack of knowledge. Moreover, other priorities and lacking capacities were listed \\nas detrimental for implementation. With regard to these obstacles, respondents rated \\nthe improvement of migration options on average as “complicated”. \\nFlexible Reserve Borders \\nAccording to the survey, flexible reserve bo rders are a measure of little effectiveness \\nto respond to the impacts of climate change (see Tab. 4-4). Accordingly, this measure \\nwas rated as “not discussed” in four of six federal states (the other two respondents could not answer make a statement on this; see Fig. 4.4-1). According to respondents, \\nthe main reasons to not implement this measure are legal obstacles; currently it is \\nlegally binding to fix reserve borders. Flexible reserve borders would violate the law. One respondent also names organisational obstacles and lacking knowledge. With \\nregard to these hurdles, two experts rate the implementation of flexible reserve \\nborders as “very complicated”, the other respondents did not give any assessment. \\nThe Concept of Process Protection \\nHalf of the respondents rated the concept of protecting processes within ecosystems as \\nan effective measure to respond to potential changes in species and ecosystem \\ndiversity and to potential changes in landscape balance (see Tab. 4-4). On average, this measure is rated as already “partially implemented”, however there are very \\nstrong differences between federal states (see Fig. 4.4-1). The highest ratings \\n(“Partially implemented”) are reported from Brandenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Saarland and Saxony. As reasons to implement the concept of process protection, \\nrespondents identified primarily the objective to make room for natural development. \\nOnly one respondent gave climate change as a motive. \\nObstacles for implementation were seen in financial restrictions (3 respondents), \\nlegislative conditions (2 respondents) and lacking knowledge (1 respondent). \\n                                              \\n \\n19 Illustration of the frequency distribution of ratings by various federal states as box-\\nplot: Each box represents the central 50% of  the distribution and therefore illustrates \\nthe values between the lower and the upper quartile.

Consequently the implementation of the concept of process protection was rated as “complicated”. \\nConcepts for Water Balance Management \\nSimilar to concepts of process protection, half of the respondents think of concepts for water balance management as effective to deal with possible shifts in species and ecosystem diversity and potential changes in landscape balance (see Tab. 4-4). On \\naverage across federal states, water manage ment concepts were rated as already \\n“partially implemented” (see Fig. 4.4-1). Two respondents – from Hamburg and Saarland – even rated these concepts as already “implemented”. Therefore water management concepts show the highest degree of implementation compared to other \\nmeasures used in the nature conservation sector in Germany. Respondents mainly \\ngave general protection goals as reasons to implement water management concepts. According to the respondents, the impact s of climate change were not among the \\nreasons to implement these measures in any federal state.  \\nHalf of the respondents saw financial and organisational obstacles to implement these \\nmeasures, a third additionally named legislative hurdles. Furthermore, other conflicting \\nuses e.g. for agriculture were seen as hurdles. With regard to these obstacles, an implementation of concepts for water balance management was on average rated as “very complicated”, while one respondent rated it as only “slightly complicated”.  \\nMeasures integrating several risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nRespondents thought of measures integrating several risks, such as insurances and the creation of reserve funds, which were also surveyed in the other climate-sensitive \\nsectors (e.g. forestry, agriculture), in general as little suited to deal with potential \\nimpacts of climate change in the nature conservation sector (see Tab. 4-4). Only one respondent rated the insurance against damages from climate change and the creation of reserve funds to prepare for future ad aptation measures and damage reparation \\npayments as effective with regard to potent ial changes in phenology of plants and in \\nlandscape balance. Nearly all respondents rated both measures as “not discussed” (one expert did not respond), which is probably explained by the fact that losses of \\nbiodiversity through climate change (e.g. species’ extinctions) can only be \\ncounteracted financially to a very limited degree. Furthermore, there are no experiences in the nature conservation sector with insurances or reserve funds. It is \\ntherefore not surprising that most experts did not give any responses concerning \\ncomplexity or obstacles to implement these measures.  \\nFurther Measures \\nMoreover, experts were asked for further measures that may be suitable to prevent \\nrisks of climate change or capitalize on opportunities in their federal states. \\nRespondents listed the following measures: ba lancing deficits of nature reserves (e.g. \\nlandscapes with strongly heterogeneous relief and microclimatic diversity to maintain \\necological niches), NATURA 2000, Life Proj ects, federal nature protection projects, \\nconversion of pine to deciduous forests, sustainable and nature-oriented land use (e.g. reduced usage of pesticides and fertilisers), extensification of agriculture, measures of renaturalisation and nature-oriented management, nature conservation oriented land \\nuse and contracted nature conservation. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Nature Conservation Departments \\nOnly three respondents from the nature conservation departments of federal states reported that there is a debate about the adaptation to climate change within their \\nadministration. However, no practical programmes aimed at tackling the impacts of climate change in the nature conservation sectors were named. Nevertheless, we got \\nthe impression that Saxony has already very intensively discussed the impacts of \\nclimate change on biodiversity and nature conservation, and that here there is collaboration between different functional departments in the context of Saxony’s Integrated Climate Protection Concept. Accordingly, asked about the current relevance ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 117}), Document(page_content='- 119 -  \\n of climate adaptation in their administration in relation to other topics, only the expert \\nfrom Saxony responded with “important”, three other experts with “slightly important”, and two with “unimportant”. Two federal states’ experts did not respond to \\nthis question. In none of the administrations this topic is rated as “very important”. \\nConsequently, the adaptation to climate change is currently of little significance in the \\nnature conservation departments in most federal states. \\nAdaptation in the Nature Conservation Sector: Summary and \\nConclusions \\nMost respondents saw the surveyed adaptation measures as effective to deal with \\npotential changes in species and ecosystem diversity, as well as changes in landscape \\nbalance – with the exception of insurances and reserve funds. Few respondents saw \\npossibilities to respond to changes in the behaviour of animals. Nearly no respondent identified an effective measure to confront changes in plant phenology. \\nThe implementation of measures that are (als o) suitable to adapt to climate change is \\na particular challenge. All measures were rated as “complicated” or “very \\ncomplicated”, so that their full implementation – which has so far only been achieved \\nfor the concepts of water balance management and in few federal states – will probably not be easy and needs special support. Moreover, it is questionable whether the existing and planned measures will suffice to confront the anticipated changes in \\nbiodiversity and nature conservation due to climate change; since, according to \\nrespondents, climate change was nearly never among the reasons to implement measures. A debate about the adaptation to climate change is currently held in only \\nvery few nature conservation departments. We therefore conclude that the impacts of \\nclimate change were not or only very little regarded in the recent planning of measures, and that the nature conservation sector in most federal states is not yet \\nadapted to climate change. \\nIn general, the nature conservation sector in Germany should have a certain potential \\nto adapt to the impacts of climate change. There is a range of effective measures, \\nsome of which have already been implemented for other reasons than climate change. \\nHowever, the implementation of these measures is mostly rated as complicated. Flexible reserve management has so far not been discussed mainly due to legal \\nobstacles. This is a particular challenge – not only for the legislator, but also for \\nsociety and its understanding of nature conservation and nature reserves. Federal states should use the opportunity to exch ange their experience and knowledge, since \\nthe degree of implementation of adapta tion measures and the state of present \\ndiscussion on adaptation to climate change was very different between federal states. \\nThe adaptive capacity of nature conservati on in the Alpine region, with its large \\noccurrence of endemic plants and animals, many azonal ecosystems and extraordinary \\nclimatic locations, is small. In this region, climate change will cause the disappearance of habitats, without alternatives for the impacted animals and plants.

Particularly the cardiovascular system is strained. For example, the heat wave \\nof 2003 presumably caused approximately 7,000 deaths in Germany. \\nChanges in the distribution, population and in fectious potential of disease vectors such \\nas blood-sucking insects, ticks and rodents are indirect impacts of climate change. \\nIncreasing temperatures improve the conditions for distribution and infection, so that \\nan increasing danger is assumed, even though the causal interactions between vector-\\nborne diseases and climate change are not yet fully understood. Particularly lyme \\ndisease (borreliosis), which is transmitted by ticks, is a distinct and increasing threat \\nto public health. There is also the potential danger of a re-occurrence of malaria \\ninfections. \\nNegative changes in environmental conditions, such as the quality of water, air and \\nfood are further indirect potential impacts of climate change. \\nPeople whose health is already stressed are especially vulnerable to impacts of climate \\nchange. This is particularly the case for elde rly and infirm people. Children can also be \\nparticularly susceptible. Furthermore, social factors, such as lacking access to \\ninformation and material resources or lacking connection to a social network can \\nincrease the vulnerability of a person to the negative impacts of climate change on \\nhealth. \\nRegionally, the upper Rhine rift and congeste d urban areas, especially in climatically \\nunfavourable locations (closed valleys) are particularly hit by the direct impacts of \\nclimate change. \\nThe necessity of adaptation (prevention and aftercare) to climate-induced health \\nproblems is often not yet fully recognised, in spite of the existence of a well-developed \\nhealth care system in Germany. In 2005, the German Meteorological Service \\n(Deutscher Wetterdienst) introduced a heat-warning system as a first measure of \\nadaptation. Measures to redesign city and building architecture (fresh air ventilation, \\ninsulation, cooling systems) so far were mainly only discussed and are far from being \\nimplemented. \\nFor vector-borne diseases there is also a lack of education and prevention measures, \\nas well as a lack of information on the interrelation with climate change. Moreover, \\nthere is only a limited range of adaptation measures to deal with vector-borne \\ndiseases. For some, vaccination is not available, and therapies are often of long \\nduration and not always successful (e.g. borreliosis). \\nIn general, there is still great uncertainty in the specific impacts of climate change on \\nhealth, particularly concerning indirect impacts. \\nThe German health care system is so far little adapted to climate change, so that \\nwithout further measures, Germany is regionally “highly”, nationwide “moderately” \\nvulnerable in the context of heat impacts.  In the context of vector-borne diseases \\nthere is great uncertainty about climate impa cts, however, given the potentially high \\nrisks and the lacking adaptation measures we rate the health sector as “highly \\nvulnerable” regarding this threat (business-as-usual scenario, see chapter 2.8). In \\nfuture, the public health sector should be able to adapt to climate change, since there \\nare various potentially effective adaptation measures, particularly in the form of \\neducation and warning, which also do not seem to be very complicated. On the other \\nhand, in the field of vector-borne diseases, education and warning seem to be almost \\nthe only effective measures. In the health sector, special support is needed to switch \\nfrom reactive to a proactive planning of adaptation measures, which also takes into ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 123}), Document(page_content='- 125 -  \\n account scenarios of future climate change, in addition to weather events and climate \\ntrends of the past. We expect a reduction of the vulnerability in the health sector to \\n“low” if the identified adaptation measures are implemented (improved-business \\nscenario, see chapter 2.8). \\n4.5.2  Health and Climate  \\nClimate influences the human body directly and indirectly (McMichael et al., 1997). \\nImmediate consequences of climate and weather conditions, particularly of thermal extremes on the human body, are consider ed direct impacts. For example, with \\nincreasing heat- or cold stress, the demands on the cardiovascular system and \\nbreathing increase (Koppe et al., 2003). Changi ng distribution, population of infectious \\npotential of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks or rodents are indirect impacts \\nof climate change. Furthermore, climate influences human health through changing \\nenvironmental conditions, such as e.g. the supply of clean water, the conditions for food production, and the danger of extrem e weather events (Jendritzky et al., 2004). \\nDirect Impacts \\nThe human body is in permanent contention with the thermal conditions of its \\nenvironment. Particularly old and weakened  people are at risk, if regionally or \\nseasonally extreme temperatures occur (Parry, 2000). \\nBesides exceeding a certain threshold of heat stress, duration, rate of change and \\npoint of time within the season (time of acclimatisation) play a role in determining \\nheat stress (Koppe et al., 2004). Comparative studies of Lisbon, Madrid and Baden-\\nWürttemberg show that mortality increases significantly on days with strong or extreme heat stress. Differences in mortality under otherwise constant conditions are determined by socioeconomic factors, among other things. High air temperatures in \\ncongested urban areas causes additional heath threats due to air pollution.  \\nIt is controversial, whether higher winter temperatures could decrease winter mortality \\ncaused by hypothermia, as well as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (WHO, \\n2003). Generally infectious diseases (e.g. influenza) mostly cause the increased mortality in winter relative to summer, with thermal conditions having only an indirect \\ninfluence as opposed to heat stress. Winter mortality is also strongly coupled to \\nsocioeconomic factors such as heating, insulation of the flat (Parry, 2004). \\nIndirect Impacts of Climate Ch ange: Vector-borne Diseases \\nMany animal pathogens, such as viruses an d bacteria are transmitted to humans by \\nvectors. Such vectors can be certain insects (mosquitoes, ticks), but also higher \\nspecies (birds, mammals). Decisive factors in the biology of the vectors and the pathogens are, among other things, the climatic and microclimatic environmental \\nconditions. The anticipated climate change will change the distribution and \\ntransmission dynamics of vectors, which will influence the diseases they transmit (WHO, 2003).  \\nIndirect Impacts of Climate Change: Deterioration of Environmental \\nConditions \\nHealth impacts through deteriorated environmental conditions are another potential \\nindirect impact of climate change. This includes the distribution of allergens in the air, \\ndegradation of the quality and quantity of water and food, as well as the degradation of ecosystems, which humans need for thei r recreation (McMichael et al., 2003).  \\nThe concentration of air-borne allergens, such as pollen depends strongly on season. \\nClimate change could cause a shift and elongation of the relevant seasons, and therefore cause an increased health threat. Furthermore, the burden of air pollution in \\ncongested urban centres with pollutants such as nitrous oxides (NO\\nx), ozone (O 3) and \\ndust (PM: particulate matter) depends on th e climate. For example, with increasing \\ntemperatures and increased radiation, secondary pollutants such as ozone develop in \\nhigher quantities. The specific impacts of climate on health through its influences on ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 124}), Document(page_content='- 126 -  \\n air quality are however as yet unclear (Parry, 2000).  \\nFuture water shortages can decrease the availability of clean drinking water and impair \\nwastewater treatment. This could increase th e occurrence of diseases. Increased “algal \\nblooms” of Cyanobacteria in rivers, lakes and the North and Baltic sea is a further \\npossible indirect impact. Some “algal blooms” excrete toxic substances. This causes water pollution that renders it unsuitable for drinking water production and recreation. \\nContamination of the body with such polluted water can cause skin rashes, coryza, and \\ngastrointestinal and pulmonary diseases. \\nThe quality of food can be impacted, e.g. through increased infestation with \\nSalmonella as a consequence of higher temperatures. However, professional storage and distribution of the food can prevent this. \\nFinally, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impacts, such as \\nflood or storm, are another health hazard. Such extreme events can on the one hand cause direct physical injuries, and on the other hand have strong impacts on human \\nmental health, through stress, anxiety states, and depression. These health hazards \\nimpact particularly coastal inhabitants, through the projected rise in sea level and the increased probability of storms (WHO, 2003). \\nIn general, knowledge on health impacts through a deterioration of environmental \\nconditions due to climate change is still sparse and largely relies on experts’ \\nassumptions. More detailed studies of  this issue are not yet available. \\n4.5.3  Baseline Situation: Health and Climate in Germany \\nThe Health Care System in Germany \\nThe vulnerability of Germans to the Impacts of  climate change on health is to a large \\nextent dependent on the future state of the health care system. In a global comparison, the German health care system currently has a very high standard. A \\ntightly woven net of physicians and medical clinics guarantee area-wide basic to \\nmaximum care in Germany. A worldwide unique network of more than 1000 rehabilitation clinics ensures aftercare following acute care. This well-developed \\ninfrastructure is presently mostly capable to counteract negative health impacts of the \\nc l i m a t e .  H o w e v e r ,  h e a l t h  c a r e  i s  d e te ri o r a t i n g  d u e  t o  t h e  n e e d  t o  s a v e  m o ne y ,  a n d  there seem to be large deficits in the context of health problems due to climate \\nchange . Additionally, there is a general need for a stronger orientation toward \\nprecaution in the German health care system. \\nBioclimate in Germany \\nThere are large regional differences in Germany, especially with regard to the thermal \\nstress on human health (Fig. 4.5-1). While there is very little heat stress in the Alps, \\nthe lower mountain regions, and at the coast, there is strong heat stress on health particularly in summer, especially in the upper Rhine rift, but also in parts of Southern \\nand Eastern Germany. In congested urban centres (particularly in closed valleys) with \\nincreased temperatures relative to their surrounding areas, strong heat stress is also to be expected. Here hot days are ofte n accompanied by additional unfavourable \\nconditions (mugginess, ozone stress), an d the temperatures are often even a few \\ndegrees higher than in surrounding areas. Particularly at night a cooling-down is \\nlacking, which would be important for periodic recovery.

Koppe and Jendritzky (2004) \\nshowed that the heat wave caused an extraordinarily increased mortality of 900 to 1300 additional deaths in Baden-Württemberg in August 2003 alone (see Fig. 4.5-2). \\nThis corresponds to an increase of approximately 16-24%. There are no exact results \\nfor the whole of Germany. However, extrapolations yield a minimum of 7,000 additional deaths (Jendritzky, 2004). Mostly elderly people were affected. Koppe et al. \\n(2003) suspect that mortality in the summer of 2003 would have been even higher if \\nthe air in Germany had not been so dry. \\nBesides the direct impacts of the heat wave on health in 2003, there were regional \\nshortages of drinking water. Moreover, toxic algal blooms occurred in the North and Baltic sea, causing the closing down of many beaches.

There is a distinct peak in August 2003 (black line), which \\ndeviates distinctly from the oscillating trend (red line). \\nIndirect Impacts \\nAmong the vector-borne diseases, the danger through diseases transmitted by ticks, mainly Ixodes ricinus , is most pressing. Due to the epidemiological significance of \\nthese diseases (tick-borne encephalitis (russian spring summer encephalitis or \\n“Frühsommer-Meningo-Enzephalitis” (FSME), Lyme-borreliosis) the most and the latest studies are found on this subject area. Some studies from Sweden and Czechia indicate an expansion of the distribution toward North and to higher altitudes. \\nHowever, it is not yet established how the distribution of (infested) ticks is actually \\naffected and enhanced by climate change (Maier et al., 2003). \\nFurther important disease vectors in Germany are mosquitoes (Culicidae), sand flies \\n(phlebotoms), black flies (Simuliidae), midges (Ceratopogonidae), fleas (Siphonaptera), bugs (Heteroptera), human lice (Phthiraptera), flies (Diptera) and \\nmites (Acari) (Maier et al., 2003). Rodents and other mammals (foxes, stray dogs) can \\nalso carry pathogens and can contaminate human food and surroundings, leading to infections.  \\nIn principle, climate change also causes the risk of malaria infections in Germany. \\nBesides the occurrence of the mosquito Anopheles  (presently mainly in the upper \\nRhine area), heat is a decisive factor in the infestation of the pathogen within the \\nAnopheles  mosquito. The risk increases significantly if the day and night temperatures \\ndo not fall below 18ºC for two weeks. Howeve r, an epidemic spread is not expected \\n(Ärzte Zeitung, 06.10.2004). \\nClimate change influences the occurrence and distribution of most of disease vectors \\nlisted here, which can lead to health hazards. Abundant data corroborate the \\ndependence of disease vectors on climate, particularly on temperature, and that for \\nexample they can react rapidly to temperatur e changes. Moreover, there generally is a \\npositive correlation between the rate of de velopment of the pathogens in the vector \\nand increasing temperature, up to a certain temperature threshold that cannot be \\nexceeded. Analysis of the present situation reveals that many non-native, thermophilic ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 127}), Document(page_content='- 129 -  \\n disease vectors have already entered Germany. However, other factors, such as e.g. \\ninternational animal trade, as well as increased transport of goods and people also lead to an increased risk of importing disease vectors. \\n4.5.4  Impact of Climate Change – Results from the Literature \\nDirect Impacts \\nThe year 2003 was an extraordinary year, however, it was shown that the probability \\nof occurrence of such an extreme year was already considerable increased within the \\nrecent decades (Schönwiese et al., 2003). Some scientist see the year 2003 as representative of climatic conditions, which will be more frequent in the next 100 \\nyears, because of the further increasing temperatures and the accompanying increased \\nfrequency of extreme temperature events (B eniston, 2004). Therefore, heat and heat \\nwave related health problems will become  more frequent in future, and finding a \\nsolution to these will become one of the essential tasks of the health care system \\n(Koppe et al., 2003). Germany is especially vu lnerable to the impact of climate change \\non health, because of the continuous enlargement of the most susceptible demographic group, the elderly.  \\nIndirect Impacts \\nThe health risk due to vector-borne diseases will increase in Germany in future. The specific contribution of climate change to this process can presently not be definitely \\nclarified (Maier et al., 2003). \\n4.5.5  Impacts of Climate Change – Assessment by Regional \\nExperts \\nAs described in chapter 2.6, we conducted expert surveys with representatives from \\nthe relevant functional departments in various climate-sensitive sectors in Germany, including the health sector. Sector-specific assessments of direct and indirect impacts \\nof climate change are available for differe nt environmental zones (see chapter 2.6) \\nfrom the following six federal states: Hamburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Thuringia, Hesse, and Baden-Württemberg. Negative ratings are regarded \\nas acknowledgments of risks, positive ra tings as acknowledgments of opportunities. \\nThe results of the survey are depicted in  Fig. 4.5-3. The assessment, which is \\ndiscussed in the following, must be seen as  preliminary, since only one expert per \\nfederal state was approached and the return of the questionnaires from the 16 federal \\nstates was scarce. On the other hand, almost half of the respondents base their assessment on studies of past and future c limate development and its impacts on their \\nfederal state. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nOn average over environmental zones and federal states, respondents rated the significance of climate change for the health sector in recent time (1990 to today) and \\nin the short-term (today to 2010) as “neither positive nor negative”, while the expert \\nfrom Berlin gave the rating “negative” for both these time periods. In the medium- (2010 to 2020) to long-term (2020 to 2050) the ratings on average turn to “slightly negative”, but the differences between rati ngs for different environmental zones and \\nfederal states increase further. In the long-term, the ratings ranged from “very \\nnegative” (upper Rhine rift in Baden-Württemberg) to “slightly positive (all environmental zones in Thuringia).

Respondents listed diseases associated with disease vectors, algal toxins, the \\nimport of new diseases through worldwide ecological changes, the long-term exacerbation of ozone and smog related prob lems, and health impacts of skin and eyes \\ndue to changes in solar radiation. \\n4.5.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nIn contrast to the United Kingdom, Portugal, Canada and the United States of America, \\nin Germany there currently exists neither an assessment of the role of climate and \\nclimate change in the public health sector, nor any precautious planning (Koppe et al., \\n2003). \\nGermany is relatively under-prepared with regard to heat-related health impacts, since \\nsuch problems appeared massively and widely in the history of Germany for the first time in the year 2003. There is a lack of  medical knowledge, education and prevention \\nmeasures and early-warning systems (Jendritzky 2005, personal communication). As \\none response, a number of federal states have produced a “catalogue of precautions \\nagainst heat”. The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) gives heat warnings since the summer of 2005. In Hesse, an early warning-system \\nbased on information from the DWD was already installed in 2004. Moreover, the \\nWorking Group of the Scientific Medical Societies (Arbeitsgruppe der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesell schaften, AWMF) installed an experts’ \\ncommission for the planning of prevention measures (Wichert, 2004). \\nStudies rate the situation of medical entomology, which is responsible for the \\nassessment of the risk of and precaution against disease-vectors and the pathogens \\nthey transmit, as problematic and deteriorating in recent decades. A national reference \\nlaboratory for diseases transmitted by ticks does exist, however, skilled professionals \\nfor the practical and scientific work in this field are lacking almost everywhere (Maier \\net al., 2003). For example, as a consequence, the dark figure of infections with \\nborreliosis is high, since this disease is often not identified and treated as such. \\nThe recommended adaptation measures given in the health sector are: \\n• Increased education of the public and th e specialised medical and nursing staff \\nabout health risks and preventive measures, \\n• The introduction of early-warning systems including locally adjusted intervention \\nmeasures, which announce temporally and spatially specific warnings and \\nrecommend behavioural guidelines, \\n• Increased medical research in this field, as well as intense monitoring of climate-\\nrelated diseases (existing monitoring network, such as e.g. the one in place at the \\nRobert-Koch-Institute, can be used here), \\n• Expansion of medical prevention and care, \\n• Implementation of technical protection measures (insulation, air conditioning, \\netc.), \\n• Reference to climate–induced health problems in public health care programmes, \\nso that suitable vaccinations and reductions of pathogens can be put in place. \\nAnother set of adaptation measures concerns the sector of climate-oriented urban \\nplanning and adapted architecture. In future, sufficient ventilation and “islands” of \\ncooler temperatures will be important particularly in congested urban areas. Buildings \\nneed to be equipped with sufficient insula tion and cooling options. With regard to \\nclimate protection, the use of alternative energy sources should be favoured in this \\nfield (e.g. through solar cooling). \\n4.5.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the survey (metho d described in chapter 2.6) with experts ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 131}), Document(page_content='- 133 -  \\n particularly from health departments and ministries from the following seven federal \\nstates: Hamburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Thuringia, Hesse, Saarland, and Baden-Württemberg.

There are large differences between federal states, particularly with regard to education, warning systems, and \\nemergency planning. Highest degrees of impl ementation (already “implemented”) are \\nreported from Hesse and Thuringia for education, from Hesse for improved warning systems, and from Baden-Württemberg for improved emergency planning. Most \\nrespondents name the experiences during the heat summer of 2003 as the reason for \\nimplementing these measures, as well as the initiative of a consortium of the higher \\nstate authorities on health, which was put into place upon suggestion of the DWD. Only the expert from Hamburg named climate change as an additional reason, but \\nexclusively for the implementation of education regarding heat waves.  \\nThe lowest degree of implementation of measures that are suitable to adapt to heat \\nwaves is found for the insulation and cooling of buildings for specific groups of people. \\nIn all federal states, this measure is either “not discussed” or “currently considered”. Only the expert from Thuringia reported this measure as already “partially \\nimplemented”. As reasons for this the respondent named modernisation and energy \\nsaving plans, but not the intention to adapt to heat waves. \\nAbout half of the respondents saw organisational hurdles as obstacles for the \\nimplementation of the four measures to adapt to heat waves. For the implementation of education, warning systems, and emer gency planning, one or two respondents \\nnamed financial hurdles, while nearly all respondents saw financial hurdles for the \\nimproved insulation and cooling of buildings. As an additional obstacle, respondents \\nreported that the precaution against heat waves was not yet an issue within political and public awareness outside of Southern Germany, which was particularly impacted \\nby the 2003 heat wave. With regard to these obstacles, respondents rated the \\neducation about heat waves and improved warning systems on average as “slightly complicated”, improved emergency planning as “complicated”, and the insulation and \\ncooling of buildings for specific groups of people even as “very complicated”. \\nExtreme Events: Education, Warning Systems and Emergency \\nPlanning \\nMost respondents thought of specific education, warning systems and emergency \\nplanning as effective to avoid injuries and fatalities through extreme events (see Tab. 4-5). Education and improved warning systems were on average across federal states \\nrated as already “partially implemented”, while improved emergency planning was on \\naverage described as “planned” (Fig. 4.5-4). However, this is based on ratings from only four and five federal states, respectively. Nevertheless, the differences in the responses from these few states were extraordinarily high: the ratings ranges across \\nthe whole spectrum from “not discussed” to “implemented”. The highest degree of \\nimplementation for all preventive measures against extreme events was reported from Hamburg, and regarding warning systems also from Berlin. \\nThe main reasons that were given for the implementation of these measures were \\nflood experiences and flood protection. None of the respondents named climate change \\nas an additional reason for implementation of these measures. Only one expert \\nresponded about obstacles to implement the preventive measures\\n21. This respondent \\nnamed mainly organisational obstacles for all three measures. Only two experts rated the complexity of the measures, and responded “slightly complicated” to \\n“complicated”. \\n                                              \\n \\n21 The targeted experts from health departments and ministries usually do not have \\naccess to the background knowledge necessary to evaluate concrete obstacles of \\nimplementation, since the implementation of measures against extreme events falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior.

Only one respondent thought of campaigns of vaccination as an effective measure to mitigate these two risks. \\nRespondents rated the education about vector -borne diseases and the related warning \\nsystems as on average already “partial ly implemented”, and the respective \\nvaccinations as “planned” – but there were marked differences between federal states \\n(see Fig. 4.5-4). In Berlin, Thuringia and Hesse, education on risks through vector-\\nborne diseases was rated as already “implemented”. In Hamburg, the highest degree of implementation is reported for warning systems, in Thuringia for vaccinations. The \\nfollowing reasons were listed for implementing these three measures: prevention, \\nlegally compulsory registration in accordance with the law on protection against infections, and observations of tick-borne encephalitis and lyme disease. The respondent from Hamburg stressed the incr eased risk of Hamburg as a seaport to \\nimport mosquitoes, rodents and flees. According to respondents, climate change did \\nnot play a role in implementing the adaptation measures. \\nRespondents did hardly report on obstacles and complexity of the measures. A few \\nrespondents named financial and organisation al hurdles, as well as lacking knowledge \\n(lacking information about incidence and prevalence). The implementation of education \\nand warning systems was rated on average as “slightly complicated”, the \\nimplementation of campaigns of vaccination as “complicated”.  \\nMeasures against water-borne diseases \\nRespondents thought of improved warnin g systems and emergency planning as \\neffective measures to prevent diseases related to possibly enhanced problems with \\nwater quality due to climate change. Two out of six respondents further thought of education as effective (see Tab. 4-5). To avoid excessive length of the surveys, we did \\nnot ask about degree of implementation, ob stacles and complexity of these measures. \\nMeasures integrating several risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nOnly one respondent thought of insurance against damages through climate change \\nand creation of reserve funds for future adaptation measures and damage reparation \\npayments as effective to respond to potential impacts of climate change (see Tab. 4-\\n5). Although we asked about the general effectiveness of these measures, representatives of health departments and ministries seem to have related this inquiry \\nonly to their specific administration. Theref ore, the impression of limited effectiveness \\nof insurance and financial reserve instruments seems justified, since these administrations mainly deal with the prevention of disease and death, rather than the \\nfinancial impacts. It is further understandable that only one respondent reported on \\nthe degree of implementation of these measures in his federal state, and rated them as “not discussed” in his administration (s ee Fig. 4.5-4). The degree of implementation \\nof insurance and reserve measures is much higher on citizen level, regarding citizens’ \\nlife insurances, occupational disablement insurances, accident insurances, health \\ninsurances and financial reserves in case of illness. \\nFurther Measures \\nMoreover, experts were asked for further measures in the health sector that may be suitable to prevent risks of climate change or capitalize on opportunities in their federal states. Respondents listed the following measures: reduction in urban heat islands through climate-suitable urban planning, climate–suitable architecture (design \\nof buildings), education about solar radiation and skin diseases, research on changes \\nin flora and fauna through spreading of toxic or allergenic species, as well as disease vectors, and long-term monitoring of health effects.

In these three federal states – Hesse, Baden-Württemberg and \\nHamburg – there are practical programmes for the adaptation to climate change, \\nwhich mainly relate to the implementation of warning systems. Hesse also collaborates \\nwith the project InKlim (integrated Clim ate Protection Program, InKlim 2012), and \\nHamburg collaborates with the Department of Hazard Protection. Asked about the \\ncurrent relevance of climate adaptation in their administration in relation to other \\ntopics, two respondents replied “important” (Baden-Württemberg and Berlin), one \\nreplied “slightly important”, and three replied “unimportant”. In none of the administrations the topic was rated as “very important”. In the health departments \\nand ministries, adaptation to climate change impacts currently seems to play a varying \\nrole, which is never very large and mostly focused on the risk of heat waves. \\nAdaptation in the Health Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nMany respondents thought of education (and also improved warning systems) as broadly effective regarding adaptation to the potential impacts of climate change\\n22. \\nMany experts list several effective adaptation strategies for each potential impact of climate change. Moreover, these measures do not seem to be very complicated. There \\nmay have been few responses on the complexity of the implementation of adaptation \\nmeasures, but many were rated as only “slightly complicated”.  \\nSuch measures are, however, not yet fully implemented in the surveyed federal states. \\nThis is particularly the case concerning preventive measures against heat waves, and within this category particularly regardin g insulation and cooling of buildings for \\nspecific groups of people. Even if few respondents regard this measure as effective, it \\nis still highly necessary: Elderly and infirm people need suitable rooms where they can stay after a heat wave warning has been issued. Most respondents rate education and warning systems as effective.  \\nThe health sector shows the highest variabili ty in the degree of implementation of \\nadaptation measures, relative to the other climate-sensitive sectors. For nearly all \\nmeasures, at least one federal state reports “full implementation”. At the same time, \\nnearly all measures are also “not discussed” in at least one federal state. Therefore we \\nstrongly recommend transfer of knowledge between federal states on sufficient means \\nand ways to implement adaptation measures.  \\nIt is doubtful whether the currently available and planned measures within the German \\nhealth sector will suffice to adequately respond to anticipated climate change impacts. \\nAccording to respondents, climate change nearly never among the reasons to implement adaptation measures. A debate about adaptation to climate change is currently taking place only in few federal states (mainly concerning the \\nimplementation of heat warning systems). Many unanswered questions in the surveys \\nare further evidence that climate change has rarely been discussed in the health sector. We therefore conclude that the impacts of climate change were not (or only \\nvery slightly) considered in present planning, and that the health sector is not yet \\nadapted to climate change n many federal states. Consequently it is time to act. Adaptation needs to be seen as long-term process; due to the inherent uncertainty in \\nconcrete future impacts of climate change, alterations in adaptation strategies will \\nbecome necessary as our scientific knowledge base improves continuously. \\nDamaging events in the past are often listed as reasons for implementing measures \\nthat are also suitable to adapt to climate change. Federal states that have already \\nbeen hit in the past by heat waves, extrem e events or increased occurrence of vector-\\n                                              \\n \\n22 We cannot draw conclusions on the measures integrating several risks, such as \\ninsurances and the creation of financial reserves, since there were only very few responses regarding these measures.

The pattern to implement preventive measures only when  a particular risk has already caused \\ndamages can also be observed in other climate-sensitive sectors (e.g. agriculture). \\nHowever, the health sector is concerned with risks of losses of human lives, losses that \\ncannot be compensated after the event, as opposed to losses in the agricultural or \\nforestry sectors. Therefore, in the health sector it is particularly important to move \\nfrom reactive to proactive planning of adaptation measures, and to take into account \\nscenarios of climate change in addition to climate trends of the past. When climate changes, past trends are poor indicators of future events.  \\nThe German health sector is not yet adapte d to climate change. However, adaptation \\nshould well be possible in future, since effective adaptation measures are available for the various potential impacts of climate change. These are mainly education and \\nwarning systems, which also do not seem to be particularly complicated to implement.

City and cultural tourism are hardly impacted by climate change – unless the \\ndestination experiences an extreme event, such as heat wave or flooding and is not \\nadapted to this.  \\nClimate change will impact directly mainly on winter tourism. In the last 50 years we \\nhave already observed a marked decrease in snow safety in the lower Alpine altitudes \\nand the German lower mountain ranges. \\nFor the future we expect that winter sport will only be possible in the Alps above \\napproximately 1500 m and in the lower mountain ranges above 800-1000 m. Artificial \\ns n o w  t o  i n c r e a s e  s n o w  s a f e t y  a n d  e l o n g a t e  t h e  s e a s o n  w i l l  o n l y  b e  a n  a p p r o p r i a t e  \\nadaptation measure in the short- to medium-term, since rising temperatures will \\nrender artificial snow making impossible at lower altitudes. \\nOwing to this trend, we anticipate a concentration of ski-tourism in higher altitudes of \\nthe Central Alps. German winter tourism will therefore rely importantly on alternative \\nactivities (hiking, cultural travels, wellness). \\nTypical forms of summer tourism, particularly beach holidays, are also impacted by \\nclimate change. Here a rather positive development in Germany is expected. Higher \\ntemperatures and lower precipitation in summer increase the attractiveness of German \\nbeach and bathing destinations and can elonga te the bathing season significantly. With \\nregard to classic destinations such as the Mediterranean losing attractiveness due to \\nsummer temperatures of partly beyond 40ºC, summer tourism could shift from \\nsouthern regions to Germany. Even for summer tourism, adaptation measures are \\nnecessary, to increase the number of weather-independent attractions in potential \\nsummer holiday destinations. \\nIndependent of climate change, tourism is prone to large variability and changes, \\nwhich depend on socio-economic conditions, changes in age structure, changes in life \\nstyle, and the fear of wars and terror. \\nIn relation to these factors, the impacts of climate change on tourism have so far been \\nrarely considered (except for winter touris m). Consequently, few adaptation measures \\nhave been discussed. In general, the offer of new activities is thought to play an \\nimportant role.  \\nThe tourism sector is so far not adapted to climate change, resulting in “high” \\nvulnerability of winter tourism, and “moderate” vulnerability to climate change impacts \\nfor the remaining tourism sector in Germany without further adaptation (business-as-\\nusual scenario, see chapter 2.8). However, the tourism sector should be able to adapt \\nin future. Losses in winter tourism could possibly be balanced by gains in summer. A \\nrange of effective adaptation options is av ailable, some of which are already being \\nimplemented for reasons other than climate change. If this adaptive capacity is used, \\nwe expect a reduction to “low” vulnerability of the tourism sector to climate change \\n(improved-business scenario, see chapter 2.8).

For example, landscape st ructure, and particularly the existence \\nand quality of bathing waters, but also the general impression of “intact nature” play a big role.  \\nOn the other hand, tourism itself can put significant pressure on various ecosystem \\nservices. In Germany, this concerns mainly the demand of land area and the conflict \\nbetween intensive use of sensitive ecosystem (water bodies, Alps, etc.) and nature \\nconservation interests. \\nSuitable climate and weather conditions are important basic conditions for holiday \\ntrips. By comparison, business and private trips are less dependent on climate and weather. Among holiday trips, particularly winter sport and some forms of summer \\nholidays, such as bathing, farm, and activity holidays depend on suitable climate and \\nweather conditions. Of less dependence are city, round, and event trips. \\nTwenty-two percent of all German holiday trips have climate- and weather-related \\nmotives. For day trips this proportion is even higher, namely 56% (Feige et al., 1999). \\nTourism has a strong international dimension and reacts to any change in the \\ncompetitive outcome between different tourism destinations. Therefore, tourism in \\nGermany is also impacted by impacts of global change in other regions of the globe (Parry, 2000). \\nNaturally, to understand the vulnerability of the tourism sector, it is not sufficient to \\nconsider climate change only. Besides climate change, other national and global \\nprocesses and events influence tourism. In recent years, losses in the tourism industry \\nhave been brought about among other things by the fear of terrorism since September 11\\nth 2001, the war against Iraq, as well as the fear of diseases (e.g. severe acute \\nrespiratory syndrome, SARS) and natural haza rds (e.g. the tsunami in South-East Asia \\nin December 2004). Besides this, economic (dollar rate, oil price, economic power) and \\ndemographic development (aging) plays an important role. \\nTourism and Climate Protection \\nTourism is not only impacted by climate change, but is one of the causes of climate change, mainly through tourism related transport and traffic. Altogether, approximately 15.8 million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted through private overnight trips within Germany in 1999 (calculated as CO\\n2-equivalents). This \\ncorresponds to 1.6% of total German greenhouse gas emissions per year. Moreover, \\ntourism by Germans in other countries caused as much as approximately 59 million tons of greenhouse gases per year during the 1990s (Schmied et al., 2001). \\n4.6.3  Baseline Situation: Tourism in Germany \\nTourism contributes approximately 8% to the German gross national product (DWI, \\n2001), and is one of the most important economic sectors. Over 106 million guests \\nfrom within and outside Germany come for on average ca. 3 overnight stays per year, \\nhosted by over 50,000 commercial accommodations in Germany (Deutsche Zentrale \\nfür Tourismus, 2004a). \\nThe number of overnight stays in Germany strongly depends on season and \\ndestination. Most overnight stays occur in summer. Among destinations, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, and North Rhine-Westphalia host most overnight stays (Federal \\nStatistical Office, 2005). \\nWithin Germany, holiday trips have the highest market share of 47%. Business trips \\nare the second biggest market share with 41%. The rest is comprised of private trips ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 140}), Document(page_content='- 142 -  \\n of varying motives (e.g. visiting relatives). Among holiday trips, city trips are most \\nfrequent, followed by bathing and farm holidays (Fig. 4.6-1). \\n10%\\n9%3%City trips\\n19%\\nBathing\\nholidays\\n16%\\nFarm holidays \\nRound trips\\n9%Health\\n8%Winter sport\\n3%Other\\n35%\\n10%\\n9%3%City trips\\n19%\\nBathing\\nholidays\\n16%\\nFarm holidays \\nRound trips\\n9%Health\\n8%Winter sport\\n3%Other\\n35%\\n \\nFig. 4.6-1: Holiday trips by Germans, by market shares (IPK, 2004a). \\nSeventy-two percent of all trips, and about 60% of the holiday trips by Germans go to \\ndestinations within Germany. In spite of this high proportion of tourism within Germany, Germany also spends the worldwide highest amount on holiday trips abroad, \\nnamely 60 million US$ (World Tourism Organisation, 2005). \\nIn the recent ten years, German tourism ex hibited only weak trends. Such were the \\ntrend toward trips within Germany, the increasing usage of air-travel due to \\ndecreasing airfares, the increase of trips for older target groups (city trips, round trips), the trend toward spontaneous trips without prior reservation (accompanied by a stronger orientation on weather forecasts), and the increase in camping holidays \\n(Deutsche Zentrale für Tourismus, 2004b). \\n4.6.4  Impacts of Climate Chan ge – Results from the \\nLiterature \\nWinter Tourism and Winter Sport \\nEven though winter tourism accounts only fro 3% of all holiday trips with overnight \\nstay in Germany (IPK, 2004a), it is locally of high importance (Alps, lower mountain ranges). Furthermore, additional guests on day trips can yield a similar gross turnover \\nas overnight guests (Harrer & Bengsch, 2003). \\nMost winter sports, such as alpine skiing, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, \\ntobogganing, snow shoeing etc. depend on snow and are therefore highly sensitive to \\nchanges in snow conditions. This large sensitivity becomes apparent already with natural climate variability, and has caused significant socio-economic losses in the \\nalpine tourism sector in the snow-poor winters at the end of the 1980s. Winters with \\ntoo much snow can also impact tourism negatively (Bürki, 2000).  \\nWinter Sport in the Alps \\nStudies on the impacts of climate change on Alpine winter sport are mostly available \\nfor the Austrian and Swiss Alps. The results can largely be transferred to Germany. \\nSimulations of snow safety in Switzerland indicate that with an increase in mean annual temperature by 2ºC by the year 205 0, only ski resorts above approximately \\n1500m would have sufficient snow (Abegg, 1996 ). With a warming by 3ºC, this limit \\nwould rise to 1800m. As a consequence, the proportion of ski resorts with sufficient snow would be reduced from 85% to 63% (with 2ºC warming), or to 44% (with 3ºC warming) (Bürki et al., 2003). A study carri ed out by Graz University (Austria) shows \\nthat by the year 2050 about half of Austrian ski resorts will have to deal with severe ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 141}), Document(page_content='- 143 -  \\n snow deficiency (Steininger & Weck-Hannemann, 2002). \\nAs a consequence of decreasing snow safety at lower altitudes, tourism can be \\nexpected to shift to higher altitudes. This increases the pressure on sensitive \\necosystems in the high Alps. Moreover, also the high Alpine resorts will be impacted \\ndirectly by climate change, particularly through increased risk to the technical infrastructure (ski lifts) as a consequence of melting glaciers and permafrost soils. \\nAmong other things, the increased number of visitors to snow-safe areas in \\ncombination with worse snow conditions in other regions (small corridors of artificial \\nsnow) can cause a severe decline in safety on the ski pistes. For example, during the \\nsnow-poor December of 2004, accidents on the ski pistes more than doubled in \\ncomparison to the same month during years with sufficient snow (Tagesspiegel, 19.01.2005).  \\nEmigration of winter tourists to other countries must be expected, since the German \\nAlps comprise few ski resorts above 2000m. This is a trend that can be observed in \\nsmaller ski resorts at lower altitudes already today, owing to aging infrastructure and \\nlacking alternative recreational offers (apres-ski, wellness, etc.) (Bürki, 2000). \\nWinter Sport in Lower Mountain Ranges \\nSki resorts in German lower mountain ranges are particularly impacted by climate \\nchange, owing to their low elevation. A stud y for the Fichtelgebirge showed that snow \\nsafety has considerably declined since 1960 (Seifert, 2004). Between 1972 and 2002, the number of days with snowfall decreased significantly at 13 of 14 studied stations. \\nUnder the assumption of a temperature increase of 0.4ºC per decade in this region, \\nonly one out of six ski resorts would have sufficient snow by 2060 (Fig. 4.6-2). Already by 2025, the conditions for winter sport in the Fichtelgebirge will deteriorate \\nconsiderably, which applies to the “natural” snow conditions, as well as to the potential \\nfor artificial snow making. Under these circum stances, the existence of a profitable ski \\nindustry seems highly unlikely (Seifert, 2004). \\nA detailed study is also available fro Ba den-Württemberg (Deutsche Sporthochschule \\nKöln, 2004). This study reaches the conclusion that climate change threatens the profitable operation of many of the 319 ski lifts of Baden-Württemberg, as well as the \\nmaintenance of cross-country skiing.  \\nSince 1950, the duration of snow cover at altitudes below 300m in Bavaria and Baden-\\nWürttemberg has decreased by 30-40%. At intermediate altitudes (300-800m) the \\ndecrease was 10-20%. However, at higher altitudes above 800m, only small decreases and partially even increases are observed, due to increased precipitation and \\nsufficiently low temperatures for snow (Günther, 2004).  \\nScenarios for the next two decades show that natural snow cover above a depth of 10 \\ncm will only persist for longer than four weeks in the higher altitudes of Baden-\\nWürttemberg. On average, below an altitude of 750 to 850 m above sea level, there will likely not persist a snow cover of a minimum of 10cm depth for more than 14 days \\nb y  t h e  y e a r  2 0 1 2 .

However, in contrast to winter \\ntourism, the climatic prerequisites of summer tourism are less well-defined and specific dependencies are hardly studied. Furthermore, climatic demands and \\ndependency of the various forms of summer tourism, such as bathing, activity, and \\nfarm holidays, vary.  \\nThe impacts of climate change on German summer tourism can only be understood \\nwithin the European context. Still many Germans spend their summer holidays in the Mediterranean region. In total, the stream of tourists from Central and Northern to Southern Europe is the most important touristic movement worldwide and comprises \\nof approximately 116 million arrivals, contributing 41% to inner-European tourism. \\nThese destinations could lose attractiveness especially during the main season, since the strongest future temperature increases are expected particularly for Southern \\nEurope, with maximum temperatures of part ly above 40ºC. Additionally this region \\nmay well experience considerable water shortages (Schröter et al. 2005). However, in low season (spring, autumn) Southern Europe remains an attractive destination (World \\nTourism Organization, 2003). \\nIn Germany, rising temperatures and decr easing precipitation will rather favour \\nsummer tourism and lengthen the summer season. For example, results from a study \\nfor Baden-Württemberg show a marked elongation of the bathing season by 17 days \\ninto spring, and by 39 days into autumn by 2050 (Wolf, 2005).  \\nAs a consequence of such “favourable” climate conditions, summer tourism may well \\nshift inland, or to Northern and Eastern Europe, along with an increased attractiveness of German destinations also for foreign guests.  \\nHowever, even in Germany summer temperatures could, at least in specific years, rise \\ninto areas that are disadvantageous fro specific forms of tourism (e.g. indoor events). \\nThis has been observed especially during the hot summer of 2003. For example, \\nconsiderably fewer visitors to museums and amusement parks were counted in Baden-Württemberg, while public pools and beer-gardens etc. profited (IHK Baden-Württemberg, 2004). ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 143}), Document(page_content='- 145 -  \\n Besides the positive developments in climatic conditions (Feige et al., 1999), summer \\ntourism at the coast could experience some negative impacts, such as rising sea levels, seaside erosion of the wadden sea (e .g. on the island Sylt), extreme events \\n(storms, storm surges, etc.), and negative influences on ecosystems (Sterr, 1996). \\nThe most important risks for city tourism, which mostly occurs in the summer months, \\nare extreme events such as floods, extreme weather conditions such as heat waves, or \\nthe increased probability of occurrence of diseases previously unknown to Germany \\n(e.g. malaria) due to climate change (see chap ter 4.5). If the cities are not adapted to \\nsuch events and fatalities occur, the mass media coverage will rapidly decrease the \\nnumber of tourists (see e.g. tsunami in Southeast Asia in December 2004). \\nFurthermore, it has to be considered that tourists are not familiar with local conditions and existing risks and adaptation measures (e.g. routines for evacuation in flood areas) and are therefore particularly vulnerab le – especially if they are elderly, which \\nis often the case for city tourists. \\n4.6.5  Impacts of Climate Change – Assessment by Regional \\nExperts \\nAs described in chapter 2.6, we conducted expert surveys with representatives from \\nthe relevant functional departments in various climate-sensitive sectors in Germany, \\nincluding the tourism sector. Sector-specific assessments of direct and indirect impacts \\nof climate change are available for differe nt environmental zones (see chapter 2.6) \\nfrom the following five federal states: Sc hleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-\\nWestern Pomerania, Berlin, and Saarland. We did not get responses from southern \\nfederal states with a high proportion of winter tourism. Negative ratings are regarded \\nas acknowledgments of risks, positive ra tings as acknowledgments of opportunities. \\nDue to the low rate of return of the questionnaires, we did not graphically illustrate the \\nresults of the survey. The assessment, whic h is discussed in the following, must be \\nseen as very preliminary due to various reasons. Only very few questionnaires were returned from the federal states, only one expert per federal state was approached, \\nand few respondents base their assessment on studies of past and future climate \\ndevelopment and its impacts. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nOn average over environmental zones and federal states, respondents rated the \\nsignificance of climate change for the tourism sector in recent time (1990 to today) \\nand in the short-term (today to 2010) as “n either positive nor negative”, with large \\nvariability in the short-term ratings of en vironmental zones and federal states, ranging \\nfrom “negative” to “slightly positive”. In  the medium-term (2010 to 2020) variability \\nbetween ratings continues to be high, but the average value shifts toward “slightly negative”. Only two ratings are available for the long-term (2020 to 2050), one of \\nwhich is “neither positive nor negative”, the other “negative”. Moreover, only two to \\nthree respondents rated elements and impacts of climate change in the long-term, so \\nthat we will not discuss the long-term assessment in the following. \\nRisk Assessment \\nAmong potential elements of climate change , respondents on average rated stronger \\ninter-annual variations in precipitation and fewer frost days as most negative. These elements were already rated as “slightly negative” in the recent past. Respondents \\nsaw increasing winter temperatures, increasing annual precipitation sums\\n23, and \\nincreased frequency of extreme rainfall events as slightly less negative.  \\n \\n                                               \\n23 According to the present state of knowledge increases and decreases in annual \\nprecipitation are possible, depending on th e region. Therefore, both developments \\nwere offered to the respondents for rating. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 144}), Document(page_content='- 146 -  \\n It is interesting to look at the respondents’ assessment of increasing average annual \\ntemperatures and increasing summer temperatures. For the recent past and the short-term future, there is a tendency to see thes e trends as positive. In the medium-term, \\nthe trends are seen as negative. \\nAll seven surveyed potential impacts of climate change  on winter tourism were seen as \\nrisks. On average the rising snow line, shorter winter season, and the migration of \\ntourists to snow safe regions (high Alps) are seen as only “slightly negative”, and \\nlarger variations within the winter season as “slightly negative” to “negative”. However, these average values are the result of neutral ratings for environmental \\nzones in which winter sport almost played no role even in the past (e.g. North Western \\nlowlands), and “negative” to “very negative” ratings for today’s winter sport resorts (e.g. Central lower mountain ranges and Harz). \\nOpportunity Assessment \\nAmong potential elements of climate change , respondents saw more hot days and a \\npossible decline of annual precipitation sums as opportunities rather than risks, while these trends were partly also rated as “slightly negative” for tourism. \\nThe potential impacts of climate change  on summer tourism were nearly universally \\nseen as positive. The biggest opportunity on average was seen in increasing tourism within Germany (and more visitors from outside Germany), due to higher \\ntemperatures and more frequent extreme events in Southern Europe and other \\ndestinations abroad. The impacts on activity holidays (sport, hiking) were also at least rated as “slightly positive’ in future. There were very strong variations between the \\nratings from different federal states and environmental zones of the possible increase \\nof bathing tourism (ranging from “negative” to “very positive”).  \\nFurther Impacts \\nWe also enquired about further possible impacts of climate change on the tourism sector. The respondents did not list any further impacts. The respondent from Berlin stressed that climate and weather hardly play a role fro city tourism, and would impact \\nonly few marginal segments (e.g. water tourism). Only extreme climate conditions \\nwould impact city tourism. \\n4.6.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nGeneral Adaptation \\nClimate change is only one of the drivers that will influence tourism in the future. \\nOther drivers, such as changes in recreational behaviour, demographic changes and \\neconomic factors have a much stronger influence on tourism in Germany. Therefore, \\nspecific adaptation measures need to be in accordance with each other.  \\nIn this context, more flexibility and a further diversification of the tourism offers in \\nGermany is needed. Among these are increased possibilities for year-around weather-independent activities (indoor-events, hot springs, exhibitions, etc.), but also \\nenhancing the attractiveness of tourist destinations through stressing regional \\nspecificities (cultural history, culinary specialities), and the improvement of educational \\nand cultural tourism offers (e.g. presentations and concerts).  \\nVarious studies on tourism and climate change conclude that the main reason for the \\nweak implementation of adaptation measures in the tourism industry is the lacking debate about climate change. Other issues (economic development, competition, etc.) \\noften seem more important and a relative short-term perspective is adopted in \\ndiscussions and operations (Bürki, 2000; Feige et al., 1999). \\nAdaptation of Winter Tourism \\nArtificial snowmaking is seen as one of the main strategies to avoid insufficient snow \\nfor winter sport. In principle, artificial sn owmaking can balance the lack of snow due to \\ndecreased snowfall, increase snow safety and lengthen the season. However, ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 145}), Document(page_content='- 147 -  \\n snowmaking potential is also impacted by climate change. Cost-effective snowmaking \\ncan only be done at temperatures below –4ºC. In the course of climate warming, snowmaking in Germany ski resorts will only be possible in the short- and medium-term and only at higher altitudes. Moreover, due to high costs of investments, \\nsnowmaking facilities are only profitable on strongly frequented pistes with high lift \\ncapacities (Lutz, 2000). Both conditions are usually not given in German ski resorts. Additionally, snowmaking has negative environmental impacts due to high water (ca. \\n1000-4000m\\n3/ha) and energy use (ca. 25,000 kWh/ha), as well as a shortening of the \\nvegetation period (Hahn, 2004). Therefore, the implementation of new snowmaking facilities should be carefully considered due to economic and environmental reasons. \\nOther adaptation measures are shifting the tourism activities from snow-dependent \\nsports to offers like guided hikes, wellness, and culture. Such strategies are recommended especially for lower mount ain ranges, which have suffered from \\ninsecure snow conditions already for some time. \\nAdaptation of Summer Tourism \\nWe do not give specific strategies for adaptation for summer tourism, because the impacts on summer tourism were complex and less predictable. However, again the \\nprinciple of diversification would increase flexibility in the face of changes. \\n4.6.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the survey (metho d described in chapter 2.6) with experts \\nfrom the following seven federal states: Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg, \\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Saarland. \\nThe following results of the survey must be  seen as preliminary assessment of the \\nmeasures that are suitable to adapt the German tourism sector to climate change, \\nsince only one expert per federal state was approached and the return of the \\nquestionnaires from the federal states was scarce. \\nIn the survey, different dimensions of the adaptation measures were evaluated; the \\neffectiveness of the measures to mitigate the potential impacts and capitalize on potential opportunities of climate change introduced in section 4.6.5 (see Tab. 4-6; here we have responses from only four experts), and the present degree of \\nimplementation of the adaptation measures (see Fig. 4.6-3).  \\nWinter Tourism: Measures to Leng then the Season and Alternative \\nOffers \\nRespondents thought of measures to lengthen the season and alternative offers in \\nwinter tourism as broadly effective regarding potential impacts of climate change (see Tab. 4-6). These measures were rated as effective especially with regard to a shorter \\nwinter season and the impacts on activity holidays. \\nOn average across federal states, these meas ures were rated as already “partially \\nimplemented” (see Fig. 4.6-3). However, there were large differences between federal \\nstates, particularly for the measures to lengthen the season. Here the degree of implementation ranged from “not discussed” to “implemented”. This is mainly due to \\nthe fact that Berlin, Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania do not host winter \\nsport tourism and therefore do not have to discuss such measures, while the other federal states rated them as already “parti ally implemented” or “implemented”. The \\nmotivation to lengthen the winter season and to diversify the tourism offer was so far \\nprimarily to enhance tourism and create jobs. Only the expert from Baden-\\nWürttemberg named climate change as one of the reasons to implement measures to lengthen the season and create alternative tourism offers.

One respondent identified climatic and environmental obstacles, e.g. for the use of  snowmaking equipment. With regard to \\nthese obstacles, respondents rated both measures to lengthen the season and the \\ncreation of alternative attractions on average as “complicated”.  \\nSummer Tourism: Increasing Regional Attractiveness \\nRespondents thought increasing the regional attractiveness in summer tourism would be an effective measure to adapt to possible impacts of climate change, such as more \\ndays with suitable weather for bathing, and impacts on activity and inland tourism (see Tab. 4-6).  \\nOn average across the seven responsive federal states, this measure was rated as \\nalready “partially implemented”, with only  very small differences between federal \\nstates (see Fig. 4.6-3). As reasons for the implementation of this measure, \\nrespondents listed among other things the general promotion of tourism and the job \\nmarket, and the constant task to renew tour ist offers and develop the industry (also \\nfor city tourism). None of the respondents named climate change as one of the \\nreasons to implement this measure. In this content one respondent stressed that it \\nwas the “tough competition” rather than climate change, which was the main problem \\nin the tourism industry.  \\nAccording to most respondents, the implem entation of measures to increase the \\nregional attractiveness for summer tourism was hindered mainly by financial and partly by organisational obstacles. With regard to these obstacles, the measures were \\nrated as “complicated”. \\nMeasures Integrating Several Risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nMost respondents related the question regarding insurances against damages through climate change and the creation of reserve funds for future adaptation measures and \\nreparation payments to their specific administration, and not to the federal state (including the tourism industry) as a whole. Therefore respondents saw these measures as ineffective to respond to impacts of climate change (see Tab. 4-6), and \\nthe degree of implementation of these measures was uniformly rated as “not \\ndiscussed” (see Fig. 4.6-3). Insurances and the creation of reserve funds are usually \\nnot an option for state agencies. Higher effectiveness and degree of implementation \\nwould result, if we had surveyed the existence of insurances and reserve funds in \\ntourism enterprises. \\nFurther Measures \\nMoreover, experts were asked for further measures in the tourism sector that may be \\nsuitable to prevent risks of climate change or capitalize on opportunities. Respondents \\nlisted the following measures: quality assurance (e.g. in maritime, youth and children tourism), promoting environmentally friendly activities (e.g. bicycle, horseback riding \\nand water tourism), as well as encouraging tourists to use public transport. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Tourism Departments \\nRespondents from the tourism departments of the federal states were furthermore \\nasked about the activities in their administrations to adapt to the impacts of climate \\nchange. Three out of seven experts replied that there was a debate about adaptation \\nto climate change in their administrations. However, their further responses gave the impression that they were actually relating to initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions (mitigation). Practical measures to adapt  to the impacts  of climate change \\nwere reported only from Baden-Württemberg.

In none of the administrations the topic was rated as “very important”. \\nTherefore, in the tourism departments of federal states, adaptation to climate change \\nimpacts currently seems to be of minor significance. \\nAdaptation in the Tourism Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nFrom responses of seven tourism experts from  seven federal states on measures that \\nare suitable to adapt to the impacts of climate change, we conclude the following25: \\nRespondents saw as effective measures to mitigate potential risk and capitalize on opportunities the lengthening of the season and the creation of alternative attractions \\nin winter tourism, and the enhancement of regional attractiveness in summer tourism. \\nThere was not a single climate change impact for which not least one respondent named an effective adaptation measure.  \\nThe measures were on average rated as al ready “partially implemented”. However, \\nresponses from the important winter sport destinations Bavaria and Saxony are \\nlacking, so that it is unclear whether this apparent high degree of implementation \\napplies for the whole of Germany, Furthermore, it is unclear if the existing and planned measures will suffice to respond adequately to the risks and opportunities of anticipated climate change, since according to respondents only in one federal state \\n(Baden-Württemberg) climate change was among the reasons to implement \\nadaptation measures. So far, a debate abou t adaptation to climate change takes place \\nin only few of the tourism departments of federal states. We therefore conclude that \\nthe impacts of climate change were not or only very slightly considered in planning \\nadaptation measures, and that the tourism sector within most federal states is not yet adapted to climate change. On the other hand, the main actors in the tourism industry \\nare not the surveyed tourism departments, but the tourism enterprises. Nevertheless, \\nit seems that hardly any enterprises have ad apted to climate change in Germany, with \\nthe possible exception of the TUI AG. \\nIn general, the tourism sector in Germany should have the capacity to adapt to the \\nimpacts of climate change in future. Losses in winter tourism could possibly be balanced by gains in summer. A range of effective adaptation options is available, \\nsome of which are already being implemented for reasons other than climate change. \\nThe adaptation through state tourism departments was mostly rated as “complicated”, with regard to primarily financial and partly organisational obstacles. \\n                                              \\n \\n25 We cannot draw conclusions on the measures integrating several risks, such as \\ninsurances and the creation of financial reserves, since there were only very few responses regarding these measures.

In summer , heat days can cause \\nproblems in road traffic (increased risk of accidents, damages to infrastructure). \\nA specific risk to all transport means in all seasons is posed by an increased frequency \\nof extreme events due to climate change, such as storms, hail, and floods. These \\nevents can lead to fatalities, the shor t-term breakdown of traffic (sometimes \\naccompanied by considerable economic losses due to losses in production), and can \\ncause damages to infrastructure (e.g. as with the Elbe flood 2002). \\nIn addition to these direct impacts of cl imate change, navigation is impacted by \\nvariations in water levels primarily on large, unregulated rivers (Elbe, Weser, Rhine). \\nStronger disruptions due to high as well as low water are to be expected.  \\nA range of primarily technological adaptation options is available to the transport \\nsector. These include the use of new materials, the construction of protective \\ninfrastructure, and relocation of transport routes. \\nIn general, potential impacts of climate change on the transport sector and necessary \\nadaptation measures are hardly discussed within science and in practice. This is a \\nconsiderable deficit, due to the national ec onomic significance of the transport sector, \\nand the potential negative impacts of climate change this sector. \\nThe transport sector in Germany is currently not adapted to climate change, resulting \\nin a present “moderate” vulnerability to th e impacts of climate change, particularly \\nextreme events (business-as-usual scenario, see chapter 2.8). \\nIn general, the transport sector should be able to adapt to the impacts of climate \\nchange in future, since a range of effective adaptation measures is available. On the \\nother hand, adaptation will probably be ve ry complicated, because one cannot rely on \\npresent knowledge or on existing adaptation  measures. Therefore, the adaptation of \\nthe transport sector needs special support, particularly with regard to education about \\nrisks and opportunities, which will arise through climate change. If the available \\nadaptation measures are implemented, a reduction to “low” vulnerability of the \\ntransport sector can be expected (improved-business scenario, see chapter 2.8). \\n4.7.2  Transport and Climate \\nTransport of people and goods is a prerequisite for the high standard of living of \\nmodern societies. Problems with the transport of raw materials, the shipping of \\nproducts or commuter traffic have far-reaching consequences for economy and society (Parry, 2000). There are specific interactions  with the tourism sector, which was also \\nanalysed as part of this study (see chapter 4.6), as tourism relies heavily on transport. \\nClimate, weather conditions and weather are important factors in transport, since they \\ninfluence safety, efficiency (i.e. cost-effectiveness), and punctuality of transport. \\nClimate and weather influence both transport means and transport infrastructure for \\nall means of transport (roads, rail traffic, navigation, air traffic). However, different transport means are impacted differently by climate change. \\nRoad Traffic \\nIn winter, snowfall, ice, fog and hail impede ro ad traffic. This leads to slow speeds of \\ntraffic, traffic jams, and an increase in the risk of accidents. Moreover, frost causes damages to roads and bridges. \\nStrong rainfall events lead to floods and the erosion of slopes, which disrupt traffic in \\nthe short-term and can also lead to permanent damages of transport infrastructure. \\nOther extreme events, such as storm and hail , also cause great damages, primarily to ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 152}), Document(page_content='- 154 -  \\n vehicles. \\nHeat waves in summer impair the concentration of drivers and can lead to an increase \\nin the risk of accidents. According to a study of the Federal Office for Road Traffic \\n(Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen), the number of accidents increases by 13% outside \\ncities, and by 22% inside cities when the temperature inside vehicles is above 32ºC (Arminger et al., 1995). Extreme temperat ures of above 37ºC even increased the \\nnumber of accidents by 33%. Moreover, high temperatures cause damages to road \\npaving (e.g. lane grooves). \\nRail Traffic \\nRail traffic is less dependent on weather than road traffic. In winter, mainly icing of the \\npower supply can impact rail traffic. In summer, particularly weather extremes are \\nimportant. These include damages to overhead contact lines (catenaries) through storms, the uprooting of trees through storms, undercutting of railroad tracks through \\nheavy rainfalls and floods, as well as track damages through extreme heat. \\nAir Traffic \\nWeather influences efficiency and safety of air traffic. Air transport is sensitive \\nprimarily to thunderstorms, strong winds, mist, fog, rain, snow and ice on the ground \\nand in the air. Winter weather conditions on airports are a frequent cause of delays \\nand potential hazards (Hauf et al., 2004). All larger airports in Germany respond to these dangers with a complex system of winter maintenance procedures. \\nNavigation \\nNavigation is also negatively impacted by frost and ice in winter. Icing over of surface waters impairs navigation and cause the need to use icebreakers. In cold winters, navigation may also be shut down completely. \\nOf even more importance is the influence of  climate on the water levels of rivers. At \\nhigh water, navigation often has to be restricted, since rapid velocities of river flows \\nendanger the ships, or because already flooded areas cannot tolerate the waves \\ncaused by navigation. During arid periods, water level can sink below a critical level, so that the discharge of cargo ships is no longer warranted. Particularly free flowing \\nrivers (e.g. Elbe, Rhine, Weser) are impacted by climate–induced fluctuations of water \\nlevels. In regulated rivers, water level fluctuations can to some extent be buffered by damming. Finally, seaports and navigation of  coastal waters can be impacted by sea \\nlevel rise. \\n4.7.3  Baseline Situation: Transport in Germany \\nIn Germany, passenger traffic is dominated by motorised individual transport. \\nPassenger cars are used by 79.1% of all people in traffic (see Fig. 4.7-1a). With 45 \\nmillion vehicles, the degree of motorisation is very high (Federal Statistical Office, \\n2005). This diminishes public transport on roads and rails, which only contributes 8% to passenger traffic. However, air traffic is of increasing significance. The number of air passengers increases continuously, which can be attributed among other things to the \\nincreasing existence of cheap airlines. Nevertheless, air traffic currently contributes \\nonly 4.6% to total passenger traffic. \\nAlso in the transport of goods, road traffic dominates (see Fig. 4.7-1b). Rail traffic has \\nlost market shares in recent years and now only contributes 15% to total transport of goods. Through-traffic plays a major role in transport of goods. Germany is known as \\nthe main mediator of through-traffic in Europe.

In Germany \\nin the year 2000, approximately 22% of total emissions stemmed from transport \\n(UBA, 2001). To this amount of carbon dioxide, the contribution of passenger cars was highest with 59%, followed by lorries with 25%, and air traffic with 8%. \\nTransport and Climate \\nThere are no concrete studies or monitoring programmes on the impacts of climate change on the transport sector in Germany so far. Therefore this impact only becomes apparent with recent extreme events, such as e.g. the heat summer of 2003. During \\nthis event, low waters caused limitations in navigation, up to the stranding of ships \\n(e.g. on the Elbe). It is unclear whether there we additional fatalities in road traffic caused by the heat, and if so how many. \\n4.7.4  Impacts of Climate Chan ge – Results from the \\nLiterature \\nThe future impacts of climate change on the transport sector in Germany have also not \\nbeen studied yet. Scenarios and projections are limited to the development of transport and its impacts on climate protec tion. In their projection of autumn 2000, \\nthe German Federal Ministry of Transport (Bundesverkehrsministerium) estimates a \\n20% increase relative to 1997 of passenger transport by 2015, transport of goods is even estimated to increase by 64%. In sp ite of progress in lessening emissions of \\nvehicles, this will go along with a tremendous increase in environmental stress, \\nparticularly in the emissions of the greenhouse gas CO\\n2 (UBA, 2005). \\nWith regard to the impacts of climate change  on transport, we anticipate that winter \\nrestrictions through frost and ice will decrease in future. This will profit all transport \\nmeans equally. Impacts on transport are primarily to be expected from an increased frequency of extreme events. Hot summer temperatures will primarily impair road \\ntraffic. On non-regulated rivers, navigation will probably be increasingly impacted by \\nhigh and low waters, and stronger fluctuations in water levels. \\nFurthermore, it is to be expected that streams of traffic will relocate due to shifts in \\nagricultural areas, and climate change related changes in recreational and holiday \\nbehaviour. This can have both positive and negative effects.

Sector-specific assessments of \\ndirect and indirect impacts of climate change are available for different environmental zones (see chapter 2.6) from the following five federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, \\nHamburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and Brandenburg. We did not get \\nresponses from southern federal states with their higher exposition to floods, frost, and snow, relative to Northern Germany. Negative ratings are regarded as \\nacknowledgments of risks, positive rating s as acknowledgments of opportunities. Due \\nto the low rate of return of the questionnaires, we did not graphically illustrate the results of the survey. The assessment, whic h is discussed in the following, must be \\nseen as very preliminary due to various reasons. With 5 out of 16 federal states, only \\nvery few questionnaires were returned from the federal states, only one expert per \\nfederal state was approached, and none of the respondents based their assessment on studies of past and future climate development and its impacts. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nOn average over environmental zones and federal states, respondents rated the significance of climate change for the transport sector in recent years (1990 to today), and also in the short-term future (today to 2010) as “neither positive nor negative”, \\nwith some ratings of “slightly positive”.  In the medium- (2010 to 2020) to long-term \\n(2020 to 2050) the average ratings range from neutral to “slightly negative”. Overall, there is appears to be a trend of slightly nega tive ratings in the past to slightly positive \\nratings in the future, with increasing differences between federal states the longer the \\nfuture time horizon. \\nRisk Assessment \\nAmong potential elements of climate change , respondents rated the more frequent \\noccurrence of extreme rainfall events as most negative. In the short-term, they were \\nrated as “slightly negative”, and in the medium- to long-term nearly uniformly as “negative”. Respondents saw increasing summer temperatures, more hot days and \\nheat waves, and an increase in annual precipitation sums\\n26 as less negative.  \\nRespondents rated stronger inter-annual variations in precipitation and a decrease in the annual precipitation sum as almost neutral, with a slight tendency toward negative \\nratings. \\nFive out of seven surveyed potential impacts of climate change  on the transport sector \\nwere seen as risks. The strongest negative ratings (short-term: “slightly negative”, \\nmedium- to long-term: “negative”) were given for the increased risk to road traffic \\nthrough extreme events (e.g. flood and storm) , and for the risk of low and high water \\nin navigation. In rail traffic, respondents rated the risk through extreme events (e.g. \\nflood and storm) in the near and distant future nearly uniformly as “slightly negative”. \\nStrong fluctuations in water levels we re also seen as “slightly negative”. \\nOpportunity Assessment \\nThe elements of climate change  increasing annual temperature and winter \\ntemperatures, as well as fewer frost days were rated as opportunities rather than risks. In accordance with this, the decrease d risk of frost and snow in road and rail \\ntraffic was seen as a “slightly positive” potential impact of climate change  on the \\ntransport sector. \\n                                              \\n \\n26 According to the present state of knowledge increases and decreases in annual \\nprecipitation are possible, depending on th e region. Therefore, both developments \\nwere offered to the respondents for rating. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 155}), Document(page_content='- 157 -  \\n Further Impacts \\nWe also enquired about further possible impacts of climate change on the transport \\nsector. One respondent listed the risk of more frequent and stronger storms for \\nrailroads and waterways, the specific danger to bridges due to more frequent storms, and the opportunity of less frequent  icing on ships and waterways. \\n4.7.6  Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change \\nSince the potential impacts of climate change on the transport sector are mostly \\nunstudied, it is understandable that little knowledge is available regarding suitable adaptation measures to climate change in the transport sector. In general, we can \\nname technological adaptations to climate change. For example, to respond to \\nextreme heat, new heat-resistant materials could be used in transport infrastructure (e.g. new pavements). Air conditioning can pr event high interior temperatures in cars. \\nTechnological measures can also be suitable against extreme events, e.g. protection \\nagainst mudflows and relocation of routes (in potential flood areas). Improved water management and the construction of new dams can counteract fluctuating water levels in rivers. However, such large-scale technological intervention measures are costly, \\nand can conflict with other objectives, in particular goals in nature conservation. In \\nareas where navigation could only be sustained with large technological interventions, a shift to rail transport should be considered. To adapt to the decreasing frequency of \\nfrost and ice days with climate change, the long-term investment in protection against \\nicing should be avoided (e.g. heating of bridges in road traffic). \\n4.7.7  Effectiveness, Degree of Implementation and Obstacles \\nof Adaptation: Assessme nt of Regional Experts \\nWe have responses from the expert survey (method described in chapter 2.6) on \\nmeasures that are suitable for climate change adaptation in the transport sector from \\nthe following five federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-\\nWestern Pomerania, and Brandenburg. There were no responses from Southern federal \\nstates. The following results of the survey must be seen as preliminary assessment of \\nthe measures that are suitable to adapt the German transport sector to climate \\nchange, since only one expert per federal st ate was approached and the return of the \\nquestionnaires from the federal states was scarce. \\nIn the survey, different dimensions of the adaptation measures were evaluated; the \\neffectiveness of the measures to mitigate the potential impacts and capitalize on \\npotential opportunities of climate change introduced in section 4.7.5 (see Tab. 4-7), \\nand the present degree of implementation of the adaptation measures (see Fig. 4.7-2).

However, according to 4 out of 5 respondents, this measure is so far “not discussed” in their federal states (see Fig. 4.7-2) (one expert did not respond to this \\nquestion). One expert explained this lack of  debate on the protection of roads against \\nextreme events by the lack of a need to do so  in his federal state. Owing to the lack of \\na debate on this topic, respondents did not name any obstacles and did not evaluate the complexity of this measure. \\nRail Traffic: Protection of Railroa d Tracks against Extreme Events \\nOnly one respondent saw the protection of railroad tracks as an effective measure to \\nrespond to the increased risk of extreme ev ents and floods (see Tab. 4-7). Four out of \\n5 respondents reported that this measure is so far “not discussed” in their federal \\nstates (see Fig. 4.7-2) (one expert did not respond to this question). To experts claimed that there was no danger of extreme events to the railroad tracks in their \\nfederal states. Again, there were no responses on obstacles or the complexity of \\nimplementation of this measure. \\nNavigation: Technological Maintena nce and Control of Water Levels, \\nShifting Transport of Goods from Ships to Rail \\nRespondents thought of the three adaptation measures in navigation as equally \\neffective with regard to the risk of high and low water (see Tab. 4-7). \\nThe degree of implementation of these measures is different (see Fig. 4.7-2). The \\ntechnological maintenance of water levels was reported as “not discussed” in two federal states (Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), and as already \\n“implemented” in two other federal states (Berlin and Brandenburg), resulting in the \\nmisleading average of “planned” (see Fig. 4.7-2). The expert of one federal state did \\nnot rate the degree of implementation of this measure. The expert from Hamburg \\nexplained the lack of a debate about technological maintenance of water levels with \\nthe lack of a need for this measure. The expert from Berlin explained the implementation of this measure with the a ssurance of navigability of the waterways; \\nthe respondent from Brandenburg gave the experiences with the Oder and Elbe floods \\nas reasons. However, the potential impact s of climate change did not influence the \\nimplementation of this measure. \\nImproved control of water levels was only evaluated by three respondents (Berlin, \\nHamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), who uniformly rated the degree of implementation of this measure as “not discussed”. Again, the expert from Hamburg \\nreported a lack of necessity. \\nThe shifting of transport of goods from ships to rail has already been “partially \\nimplemented” in Hamburg (due to problems with capacity for transport of goods), \\nwhile this measure is “not discussed” in the federal states Brandenburg, Berlin, and Schleswig-Holstein (there was no respon se from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). \\nSince the three surveyed measures were most ly “not discussed” in navigation, it is \\nunderstandable that respondents did not reply to questions on obstacles and complexity of the measures. \\nMeasures Integrating Several Risks: Insurances and Reserve Funds \\nRespondents reported that measures integrating several risks, such as insurances and the creation of reserve funds, which were al so surveyed in the other climate-sensitive \\n                                              \\n \\n28 We were puzzled by the response of two ex perts that the protection of roads against \\nextreme events was an effective measure to  respond to decreased risks of frost and \\nsnow following climate change.

From the responses in other climate-sensitive sectors we know that respondents – representatives of functional departments – mainly thought of an implementation of this measure through agencies and federal bodies, which is \\nnaturally not probable. It is well possible that we would have found higher degrees of \\nimplementation of these measures, had we surveyed transport enterprises. \\nFurther Measures \\nMoreover, experts were asked for further meas ures in the transport sector that may be \\nsuitable to prevent risks of climate change  or capitalize on opportunities. Only one \\nexpert responded to this. He named bette r predictions of storms (frequency and \\nstrength) for an increase safety in navigation and rail traffic. \\nAdaptation to Climate Change in Transport Departments \\nOnly two out of five respondents from th e transport departments of federal states \\nreported that there is a debate about the adaptation to climate change within their \\nadministration. However, no practical programmes in these two federal states – \\nBrandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania – aimed at tackling the impacts of climate change in the transport sectors were named. Asked about the current relevance of climate adaptation in their administration in relation to other topics, these \\ntwo experts responded “slightly important”, the three other experts with \\n“unimportant”. None of the respondents chose “important” or “very important”. Also with regard to the very low rate of return of questionnaires, we conclude that \\nadaptation to climate change is currently of nearly no significance in the transport \\ndepartments in most federal states. \\nAdaptation in the Transport Sector: Summary and Conclusions \\nOverall, the German transport sector so far is very little adapted to climate change. A \\ndebate about adaptation to climate change seems to occur only in very few transport \\ndepartments of the federal states. The knowledge of potential impacts of climate change, as well as the degree of implementation of measures that are suitable to \\nadapt to climate change is in general rather low. In comparison to the other surveyed \\nclimate-sensitive sectors, the transport sector  exhibited the lowest rate of returns of \\nquestionnaires. This is also an indication that there is little debate about adaptation to \\nclimate change, and a low degree of adaptation in the transport sector in Germany (at \\nleast for federal bodies). \\nIn general, the transport sector should be able to adapt to potential impacts of climate \\nchange in future. A range of effective adaptation measures is available. On the other \\nhand, adaptation will probably be very comp licated; it can hardly be based on existing \\nknowledge or measures. At the same time, the transport sector is faced with other \\nchallenges (e.g. Toll Collect, the decree on particulate matter).

Besides representatives from science, policy and administration, the participants of this workshop were mainly representatives from \\nfree enterprises and associations from the studied climate-sensitive sectors forestry, \\nwater, tourism, nature conservation, heal th and transport. The representative of \\nagriculture had to cancel at the last minute. \\nIn addition to the presentation from the study reported here, two further scientists \\npresented on the subjects “Probabilities of  the Occurrence of Climatic Extreme Events \\nin Germany” and “Decision-making, Communication and Dealing with Uncertainties”. \\nThe workshop program, as well as the wo rkshop goals are found in chapter 2.7. \\n5.1 Results of the Participants’ Interviews Prior to the \\nWorkshop \\nPrior to the workshop we conducted participants’ interviews via written questionnaires. \\nWe particularly assessed the expectations participants had concerning the workshop. \\nThe responses concerned two categories of expectations, (1) information and \\ndiscussion, and (2) networking. \\nExpectations Regarding Information and Discussion \\nThe highest proportion of expectations concerned scientific information on specific topics. Respondents expressed the need for information and discussion on the \\nfollowing topics: climatic development (and gaps of knowledge about this); impacts of \\nclimate change (as concrete and regionally specific as possible); probability of climate \\nimpacts; risk and vulnerability assessment; monetary/economic and ideal costs with \\nand without adaptation; overview of the Ge rman situation and particularly impacted \\nsectors, groups and regions; dealing with uncertainties; communication of \\nuncertainties; help in the “translation” for policy consultancy and education; \\nadaptation measures (present and future); ov erview of the expectations of different \\nactors; work and goals of the Federal Environmental Agency concerning climate \\nimpacts; plans of the federal government and other activities in Germany. \\nNearly all these topics were covered by the presentations during the workshop. Merely \\nthe demand for information on monetary/economic and ideal costs with and without \\nadaptation could not be met. However, an approximate qualitative assessment of costs can be found in the comparison between vulnerabilities with and without further measures (see chapter 4).  \\nExpectations Regarding Networking \\nBesides the need for information and discussion, respondents also voiced a demand for networking. Specifically, this included the networking between other enterprises within \\ntheir sector, with other actors beyond their sector, between public and private \\nstakeholders, between research institutions  and federal states, and generally between \\neconomy, administration, policy and science. \\nIn these networks, stakeholders hope to exchange information and seek opportunities \\nto coordinate the implementation of adaptation measures to climate change. In this context stakeholders encouraged a coordinated push of information regarding climate \\nimpacts and adaptation in economy, administrations, policy and science. \\nMoreover, one participant wished to integr ate between the topics climate adaptation \\nand other challenges, primarily flood and climate protection.  \\nThe workshop was a first step to fulfil thes e needs for networking, which were partly \\nalready very implementation-oriented. Fo r the Federal Environmental Agency, the \\nworkshop was the first event of a long-term dialogue on the adaptation to climate change in Germany between actors from policy, administrations, economy, and non-', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 161}), Document(page_content='- 163 -  \\n governmental organisations. The creation of such a network is in accordance with the \\nplans of the Federal Environmental Agency to create a Centre of Competence for \\nClimate Impacts  starting in 2006, which will be an information platform for climate \\nimpacts and adaptation in Germany. In this context collaboration with the German \\nFederal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und \\nForschung) is sought. \\nGeneral Assessment of Climate Change \\nIn the pre-interviews, respondents were al so asked for their general assessment of \\nclimate change, in addition to their expectations. This question was also asked in the Regional Experts’ Surveys, and those results are discussed in chapter 4.  \\nThe exact question was: If you look at clim ate change as a whole, what do you think \\nof the climate change impacts on your professional sector? The average rating for the sectors for which we got responses was negati ve, with increasing negativity over time \\n(see Tab. 5-1). \\nTab. 5-1: General assessment of climate ch ange by workshop participants. The mean \\nresponse values of the following qualitative rating scale are shown: -3 (very negative), \\n-2 (negative), -1 (slightly negative), 0 (neither positive nor negative), +1 (slightly positive), +2 (positive), +3 (very positive). \\n \\nCurrent Importance of the Adaptation to Climate Change \\nFurthermore, we enquired about the current importance of climate change adaptation \\nin the organisations and administrations of the workshop participants. The exact question was: What level of importance does the adaptation to climate change \\ncurrently have in your organisation or administration – also with regard to other \\nproblems and challenges with which your organisation or administration is currently dealing? \\nThis question had also been posed in the Regional Experts’ Surveys (see chapter 4). \\nRelative to their responses, the level of importance of the topic climate change adaptation was high in the organisations and administrations of the workshop \\nparticipants (see Fig. 5-1). \\nBiodiversity\\nForestry\\nWaterHealth\\nState \\nRepresentativesin recent past -0.3 -1 -0.4 -1 -0.5\\nin the short-term -0.3 -2 -0.8 -1 -1in the medium-term -1 -2 -1.6 -1.33in the long-term -1.3 -2.33 -2.25', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 162}), Document(page_content='- 164 -  \\n  \\nFig. 5-1: Current importance of adaptation to climate change in the organisations of \\nthe workshop participants. Qualitative scale of replies: unimportant – slightly \\nimportant – important – very important. \\n5.2 Results of the Workshop \\nEven if the pre-interviews with workshop participants indicated a high level of \\nimportance of climate change adaptation in their organisations and administrations, \\nthis did not mean that they relied on a high level of knowledge about climate change \\nand its impacts in Germany. The strong desire to receive information, which was already apparent in the pre-interview respon ses, prevailed also during the workshop. \\nThis apparent need of decision-makers for information and support with regard to \\nimpacts of climate change in Germany may be seen as the main result of the workshop. \\nTrust in the Scientific Results on Climate Change \\nTo explain climate change and its impacts, two presentations were given during the workshop. Prof. Schönwiese (Meteorological Institute of Frankfurt University) based his talk “Probabilities of the Occurrence of Ex treme Events in Germany” on statistical \\nanalyses of climate and weather events in the past , and stressed that there always has \\nbeen climate change. However, since approximately the middle of the last century, new positive trends in temperature establish,  which have become stronger particularly \\nin the recent decades. The development of this trend is mainly anthropogenic. Dr. \\nZebisch (Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research), co-author of this study, then \\ngave a presentation on “Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture, Forestry, Water Management, Nature Conservation, Tourism, Transport and Health in Germany”. \\nThis was based mainly on computer models of global change, which simulate climate \\nchange and its impacts in the future on th e basis of scientific assumptions (see also \\nchapter 2). The results presented in both talks have been integrated into chapters 3 \\nand 4 of this report. \\nIn the afternoon’s discussions, these tw o presentations and their relevance for \\ndecision-makers were debated. The questi on was, whether decision-makers orient \\nthemselves rather on future scenarios and projections, or on time series and trends of \\nthe past. Some participants claimed the latter. In contrast, other participants reported to base their planning on cl imate scenarios of the future. \\nThe discussion showed the significance of tr ust in scientific results. Some decision-\\nmakers voiced scepticism particularly with regard to climate models of the future, \\nwhich, in contrast to trends of the past, they cannot compare with their own personal \\nexperience. The importance of trust in the results of climate models and the possibility to establish this trust are therefore subjec t of chapter 6.2.2. However, trust building unimportant\\n0%\\nslightly\\nimportant\\n31%\\nimportant\\n45%very important\\n12%missing \\n12 % ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 163}), Document(page_content='- 165 -  \\n does not include the concealment of existing uncertainties in future scenarios, as the \\nflowing section shows. \\nUncertainty \\nThe assessment of future climate change and its potential impacts comes naturally \\nwith a certain uncertainty. Even with fu rther improvement of scientific methods, \\nresults will always remain somewhat uncertain. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is only predictable to a certain extent, as is the reaction of the climate \\nsystem to these greenhouse gases. \\nThe uncertainty of risk information often leads to obstacles in risk prevention. \\nTherefore we explicitly addressed the constructive management of uncertainty and \\nunspecific hazard potentials within the stak eholder-workshop with a presentation given \\nby Prof. Gigerenzer (Max Planck Instit ute for Human Development, Berlin) on \\n“Decision-making, Communication and Dealing with Uncertainties”. \\nIt is often assumed that the communication of uncertainty inherent in scientific results \\nwould impair their credibility. Using the Ba nk of England as an  example, of Prof. \\nGigerenzer showed that the opposite is true. The Bank of England is known for \\ntransparent communication of uncertainties in its projections of the development of \\neconomy and currencies, at the same time it is the organisation enjoying the highest credibility in England. In the end, avoiding communication of uncertainty in projections \\nresults in loss of credibility of the communicating institutions, when the projections are \\nwrong (see also chapter 6.2.2). \\nFollowing Prof. Gigerenzer’s talk, a discussion about the model of the “informed \\ncitizen” sprang up. This model is currently used particularly on European level. A change in mentality is needed to transform the old ideal of the “protecting \\nadministration” to the model of “informed citizens”. To make educated decision-\\nmaking possible, citizens need many sources of information. Here, the adequate communication of risk will play an important role. According to Prof. Gigerenzer, the \\ngoal of this development should not only be  the “informed” but also “serene citizen”, \\nwho knows not only about the existing risks but also how to deal with them serenely. \\nDealing with uncertainty takes not only a serene attitude, but also concrete decisions. \\nHow one can systematically deal with uncertainty of climate change in the decision-\\nmaking process is illustrated by the decision support system introduced in chapter 6.2.4 (see also chapter 6.2.3).  \\nAdaptation \\nAdaptation measures to respond to the impacts of climate change were the subject of the presentation “Adaptation Measures in Germany – Exploiting Opportunities and Mitigating Risks” given by Mr. Grothmann (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact \\nResearch, PIK), co-author of this study. Primarily, results from an experts’ survey with \\nrepresentatives of the functional departments of federal states for the sectors agriculture, forestry, water, nature conserva tion, tourism, transport, and health were \\npresented. These representatives were asked about the effectiveness, the degree of \\nimplementation, the obstacles and the complexity of measures that are generally suitable to adapt to climate change (e.g. conversion to mixed forests in forestry), even \\nif they had been implemented for other re asons (see also chapter 2.6). This survey \\nwas conducted to get an impression of the current state of adaptation in Germany and the vulnerability to future impacts of climate change without further adaptation measures (see chapter 2.8). The main result of this survey is that measures, which are \\ngenerally suitable to adapt to climate change (e.g. flood protection measures), are \\nalready partially implemented in many sectors but still need to be adjusted accordingly. So far, none of the studies sectors seems to be fully adapted to climate \\nchange. Mr. Grothmann concluded that all se ctors had the adaptive capacity to adapt \\nto climate change in future, since they can often rely on existing measures and the obstacles for of adaptation to climate change rarely seem insurmountable. \\nThe subsequent discussion revealed that the presentation of measures that are ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 164}), Document(page_content='- 166 -  \\n generally suitable to adapt to, but have not been motivated by climate change is \\nmistakable. The rating of such measures as partially implemented was in particular misunderstood by participants and evoked th e impression of the conclusion that there \\nwas hardly any need for further action to adapt to climate change. Furthermore, the \\nreliability of the responses was doubted. Particularly the current degree of \\nimplementation of measures was believed to be easily overestimated. Therefore, when \\npresenting these results in this report (particularly chapter 4) we strongly emphasize \\nthat the survey results are only a preliminary assessments, and that measures that \\nare generally suitable to adapt to climate change are not yet fully implemented in most sectors, and also not yet adjusted to the particularities of climate change. Therefore, we conclude that none of the studied sectors is yet adapted to climate change. \\nOne participant remarked, that there is a need to distinguish a general strategy for \\nclimate change adaptation from specific adaptation measures, whose implementation \\nis justified also by motives besides climate change. This remark was related to the \\nfalse impression, that the conclusion from th e experts’ survey was that there is hardly \\nany further need for action in the adaptation to climate change. We have indeed \\nenquired about the existence of specific st rategies and programmes within the survey. \\nThe sobering outcome of this is presented in chapter 4. \\nParticipants encouraged the inclusion of experts from outside federal administrations \\n(e.g. from economy and environmental organisations), and the use of telephone interviews rather than written questionnaires to obtain more reliable experts’ assessments in the future. Both were not possible in the presented survey, owing to \\nfinancial restrictions. \\nFurther Networking \\nIt seems desirable to expand the network of  actors that was initiated through this \\nstakeholder-workshop, just as the inclusion of further experts in the surveys would be \\nuseful. Asked about institutions and organisations that should be invited as actors in the context of climate change adaptation, participants listed the following: further federal ministries besides the Federal En vironmental Agency (e.g. German Federal \\nMinistry of Education and Research, German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and \\nEmployment), the German commi ttee of hazard prevention, national advisory bodies \\n(German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), the Sustainability Council etc.), \\nThe Association of German Cities and Towns, and trade associations. For the nature \\nconservation sector, participants named the Working Group of the Federal States on Nature and Landscape Conservation and Recreation (LANA), for agriculture the \\nNational Farmers’ Union, for forestry the German Forestry Council, for the water sector \\nNational/Federal Working Group on Water (LAWA), for transport the German Transport Forum, and for the health sector the Action Programme Environment and Health. Furthermore, the inclusion of the financial sector (banks and re-insurance companies) \\nwas demanded. From science, participants encouraged the inclusion of economic \\nresearch institutions and climate researchers. Finally, networking with activities in other nations (e.g. within the EU) was suggested. \\nExpectations of Further Support \\nAs apparent in the pre-interviews and the during the workshop, decision-makers had a \\nhigh demand for information and support regarding the question which impacts of \\nclimate change threaten Germany and which adaptation measures are available. \\nRepresentatives from federal states voiced the need for a consistent database within \\nGermany and standardised climate scenarios. Besides this, the information demands \\nfrom the different sectors varied partly, but were often similar: \\n• Water sector: homogenisation of adaptation research; report of the state of affairs. \\n• Agriculture: regional climate scenarios; sustainable adaptation strategies. \\n• Forestry: future potential natural vegetation; research on ecological stability; \\nsensitivity of different forest communities; possibilities of support for adaptation measures.

This Centre is intended to function as  a central information platform for climate \\nimpacts and adaptation in Germany. In this, collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research is sought. \\nIn her presentation “Tasks and Structure of the Centre of Competence for Climate \\nImpacts at UBA” Ms. Mahrenholz (Federal Environmental Agency, UBA, Dessau) introduced the envisioned goals, tasks and products of the Centre of Competence. In \\nthe subsequent discussion various questions enquired about the concrete orientation of \\nthe planned Centre. Ms. Mahrenholz stressed that the Centre will not conduct science, but focus on a pragmatic, demand-oriented exchange of information. Similar to the \\n“United Kingdom Climate Impact Programme (UKCIP)” the main task is the praxis-\\noriented counselling and support of actors, whose sectors are potentially impacted by climate change. \\nThe workshop participants welcomed UBA’s initiative for such a Centre of Competence \\nin the sense of a central German information and networking platform for the \\nadaptation to climate change. Competences an d tasks will need to be clearly defined, \\nto make the division of tasks between the federation and the states transparent. \\nMs. Harnisch (Federal Ministry for the Envi ronment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear \\nSafety, BMU, Berlin) explained that the ad equate reference to the necessity of a \\nnational strategy for the adaptation to climate change is part of the agenda in the current evaluation phase of the “National Climate Protection Programme 2000”. \\nIn the Centre or Competence the dialogue between actors in adaptation is planned to \\nplay a major role. In this context, we discussed the question whether future workshops \\nshould be organised per specific sector or across sectors. One suggestion envisaged \\nworkshops with sections that address cross-sector issues and sections that are sector specific. \\nThe next stakeholder-workshop is planned for the beginning of 2006 and coincides \\nwith the planned start of the Centre of Competence.

Often a region or sector is already under pressure today. Basic climatic or environmental conditions can pose constraints (e.g. insufficient precipitation or poor \\nsoils in agriculture and forestry). Many sectors are influenced by changes in socio-\\neconomic basic conditions (e.g. agriculture, forestry, health, tourism, transport). Such \\nbasic conditions strongly determine a region’s or sector’s predisposition with regard to the negative impacts of climate change and are decisive for the regional differentiation \\nof vulnerability.  \\nBesides its predisposition, the vulnerability of a region or a sector to climate change \\ndepends mainly on three factors (chapter 1.3.3): \\n• What are the characteristics of climate change and other elements of global \\nchange in the respective region? \\n• How large are the potential impacts of global change within the region on the \\nspecific sectors? \\n• What is the degree of adaptation in the sp ecific sectors within the region to the \\npotential impacts? \\nThe degree of adaptation depends on the implementation of adaptation measures, \\nwhich mitigate damages or capitalize on opportunities. \\nVulnerability without further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario) results if the \\ncurrent degree of adaptation is maintained into the future. This kind of vulnerability is \\nalso referred to as current vulnerability . When assessing this vulnerability, we assume \\nthat no further adaptation measures be yond already existing ones (e.g. flood \\nprotection) are implemented. Under this a ssumption, future risks of damages due to \\nglobal change are assessed on a qualitative scale with three categories (low – \\nmoderate – high vulnerability). In this way we convey an impression of which damages \\nare to be expected in Germany, if no furthe r adaptation to global change (particularly \\nclimate change) is achieved. \\nIf we assume that present adaptive capacity  will be fully used to improve the future \\ndegree of adaptation, we obtain vulnerability with further adaptation  (improved-\\nbusiness scenario). As before, this vulnerability is assessed on a qualitative scale with \\nthree categories (low – moderate – high vulnerability). By comparing vulnerability without  further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario) and vulnerability with further \\nadaptation (improved-business scenario) we obtain an impression of the risks of \\ndamages due to global change (particularl y climate change) with and without further \\nmeasures of adaptation. \\nIn summary of the results on vulnerability without  further adaptation (business-as-\\nusual scenario) on the different sectors, se parated by region (environmental zones, \\nFig. 6-1), the highest vulnerability to climate change within the selected climate-\\nsensitive sectors is exhibited by Southwest Germany (upper Rhine rift), the central \\nparts of Eastern Germany (North-Eastern lowland, South-Eastern basin and hills), and the Alps (see Tab. 6-1). The lowest vulnerability is assessed for the German low \\nmountain ranges and Northwest Germany. Among sectors, particularly the water, \\nhealth and winter tourism sector are highly vulnerable. \\nThe vulnerabilities in most regions could probably be lessened to a low level, if all \\navailable potential adaptation measures were implemented in the specific regions and environmental zones (improved-business scenario). However, in most regions adaptation measures to climate change are neither planned nor implemented. This is a \\nstrong call for action. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 167}), Document(page_content='- 169 -  \\n 6.1.1  Regions \\nIn Eastern Germany  (North-Eastern lowland, South-Eastern basin and hills), low water \\navailability and the risk of summer droughts account for the high current vulnerability \\nin many sectors. The present unfavourable climatic water balance will be exacerbated by the already observed and further expected decrease in summer precipitation, as \\nwell as by increased evaporation due to increased temperatures. This will in particular \\nimpact agriculture and forestry, as well as the transport sector (navigation). Additionally, there is a “high” vulnerability without further adaptation with respect to flooding in the large river basins of th e Elbe and Oder. In the Lausitz, where \\nparticularly high summer temperatures are expected, the current vulnerability in the \\nhealth sector is “high”, owin g to strong heat stress.  \\nIn Southwest Germany  (upper Rhine rift) especially the high temperatures will cause \\nproblems. This region, where the highest temperatures are measured today, is expected to show the strongest warming in Germany in the future. This causes “high” \\nvulnerabilities without  further adaptation in the health sector. Furthermore, agriculture \\nand forestry are “highly” vulnerable to rapi d warming. Moreover, th e risk of flooding in \\nthe early spring increases, owing to a shift of precipitation from summer to winter, as well as an increase in extreme rainfall events. \\nCoast North-East \\nGerman lowland\\nSouth-Eastern \\nbasin and hills\\nErz Mountains, \\nThuringian and \\nBavarian Forest \\nAlpine foothills Upper \\nRhine rift\\nAlpsOberrheingrabenLow mountain \\nranges left and \\nright of RhineWest German lowland bay North-West German lowland\\nAlp and North Bavarian hillsCentral low \\nmountain ranges \\nand Harz\\nCoast North-East \\nGerman lowland\\nSouth-Eastern \\nbasin and hills\\nErz Mountains, \\nThuringian and \\nBavarian Forest \\nAlpine foothills Upper \\nRhine rift\\nAlpsOberrheingrabenLow mountain \\nranges left and \\nright of RhineWest German lowland bay North-West German lowland\\nAlp and North Bavarian hillsCentral low \\nmountain ranges \\nand Harz\\n \\nFig. 6.1. Environmental zones in Germany (aggregated from BFN, 2005). \\nThe sensitivity of many sectors is the main reason for the “high” vulnerability without  \\nfurther adaptation in the Alps, in addition to expected climate change, which is slightly \\nabove average in the Alpine region. Especial ly in the nature conservation sector, the \\nAlps are very vulnerable, because they are characterised by many endemic plant and animal species, which hardly have any migratory alternatives when climate changes. Furthermore, the abundance of unique microclimatic locations and azonal biotopes \\nincreases vulnerability. In the Alps the risk of flooding is particularly high, owing to the \\nlack of retention areas. Finally, the winter tourism sector is highly sensitive and not very adaptive to a decrease in snow safety.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 168}), Document(page_content='- 170 -  \\n In comparison, the German low mountain ranges  currently show “medium” \\nvulnerability. At present the climate in thes e regions is cool and moist, so that a \\nchange to a warmer climate can actually pose an opportunity for some sectors (e.g. agriculture). There is “high” vulnerability against flooding, especially for local high \\nwater events, caused by convective extreme rainfall events. Winter tourism, if present, \\nalso shows “high” current vulnerability. \\nSimilar to the low mountain ranges, the coastal regions  exhibit only “medium” \\nvulnerability. However, there is “high” current vulnerability caused by possibly more intensive storm surges. Moreover, the immediate coastal areas are threatened by the \\nrising sea level. But the implementation of  adaptation measures has already advanced \\nrelatively far. In other sectors coastal regions may well profit from climate change. This concerns the sectors agriculture and forestry, as well as tourism, which will profit from rising summer temperatures an d decreasing summer precipitation. \\nThe lowest current vulnerability was assessed for Northwest Germany. Climate change \\nwill probably be least pronounced in this region, because it is attenuated by oceanic \\neffects. Due to the presently very moderate climate, most sectors exhibit a wide range \\nof tolerance. Again, the sectors agriculture and tourism, and with some limitations also forestry, may potentially profit from climate change. \\nBesides the regions and environmental zones portrayed in Tab. 6-1, wetlands  and \\ncongested urban areas  show “high” vulnerability without further adaptation. In \\nwetlands, especially the sectors water and nature conservation are highly vulnerable. \\nIn congested urban areas, especially the sectors health (heat stress) and transport will \\nbe affected. \\nThe vulnerabilities in most regions could probably be lessened to a low level, if all \\navailable potential adaptation measures were implemented in the specific regions and environmental zones (improved-business scenario). However, in most regions \\nadaptation measures to climate change are neither planned nor implemented. In the \\nAlpine region, vulnerability can probably only be reduced to a medium level, since the adaptive capacity to the potential impacts of climate change on winter tourism, \\nbiodiversity and flood risk is limited. \\n6.1.2  Sectors \\nIn all parts of Germany current vulnerability is “high” in the water sector, due to \\nincreasing flood risk and high potential for damage. Further regional differentiation of \\nthe expected impacts is currently not possibl e due to the uncertainties related to the \\nmodelling of regional precipitation patterns.  In addition, the risk of droughts is \\nincreasing, particularly in Eastern Germ any. Currently, few adequate adaptation \\nmeasures to this stress are locally available. This results in locally “high” current \\nvulnerability. However, for the entire country there appears to be only moderate \\ncurrent vulnerability to droughts in Germany.

Climate change also \\nimpacts indirectly through increased risk of diseases and pest outbreaks. However, the \\nagricultural sector can adapt to changed climate and weather condition on a short-term basis due to its large choice of crop types and varieties, as well as short rotation \\ntimes. The sector has adapted frequently on the past. Therefore, the agricultural \\nsector seems to be only “moderately” vulnerable to climate change without further adaptation specifically to climate change . Vulnerability is rated to be “high” merely in \\nthe drought-prone areas of Eastern Germany with poor soils. \\nSimilarly, the forestry sector  is impacted by aridity and increased risk of diseases and \\npests. In addition, there is increased risk of forest fires and extreme events. The \\nforestry sector has limited adaptive capacity due to long rotation times and high costs. Drought-prone areas (Eastern Germany), as well as regions with a high proportion of out-of-natural-habitat spruce stands (lower regions in Western and South-Western \\nGermany) are rated as “highly” vulnerable. In general, the forestry sector is classified \\nas “moderately” vulnerable to climate change.  \\nTo rate vulnerability in the sector  nature conservation  is especially difficult. Definite \\nimpacts of climate change are expected (shifts in species’ distribution, changes in species communities etc.), however, there is no consensus on the relevance of these \\nimpacts. The current vulnerability is rated as “moderate” to “high”, depending on the \\nconservation goal. Adaptation measures (e.g. improved connections within the conservation network) can only support natural processes (e.g. migration), but clearly cannot conserve the current community of species. \\nWithout further adaptation, the health sector  is rated as regionally “highly” vulnerable \\nto impacts of heat waves, generally in Germany as “moderately” vulnerable. High \\nuncertainty exists with regard to climate change impacts on vector-borne diseases. \\nNevertheless, due to the high potential risk and the current lack of adaptation the vulnerability to vector-borne diseases seems to be “high”. \\nIn the tourism sector , winter sports particularly are classified as “highly” vulnerable. \\nDecreasing snow safety must be expe cted, for which no adequate long-term \\nadaptation measures are available. Other forms of tourism are “moderately” \\nvulnerable. Leisure-oriented summer tourism will probably profit from climate change. To date, there has been little debate on vuln erability to climate change in the German \\ntourism sector. \\nThe transport sector  is primarily at risk due to a potential rise in the frequency of \\nextreme events (storms and extreme rainfall events), as well as due to extreme heat \\nin summer. This impacts both the flow of traffic and the infrastructure. In winter, the \\ntransport sector is likely to profit from climate change (less frost days). In general, the vulnerability of the transport sector is rated as “moderate”. Navigation is likely to be \\nthe area of highest impact, due to strongly fluctuating water levels of rivers. As with \\ntourism, to date, there has been little debate on vulnerability to climate change in the German transport sector. \\nThe vulnerabilities in most sectors could probably be lessened to a “low” level, if all in \\nthe specific sectors available potential adaptation measures were implemented (improved-business scenario). In the nature conservation sector alone, vulnerability \\ncan probably be reduced only to a “moderate” degree due to limited adaptation \\noptions.  \\nHowever, in most sectors – as well as in most German regions – adaptation measures \\nto climate change are neither planned nor implemented. Consequently there is an urgent need for action. \\n6.2 Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change in \\nGermany \\n6.2.1  Adaptation and Emission Reduction \\nThe rate and degree of climate change, which took place during the 20th century, are ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 171}), Document(page_content='- 173 -  \\n unprecedented. Meanwhile, there is overwhelming consensus in the scientific \\ncommunity that the main cause of climate ch ange is human activity, in particular the \\nemission of greenhouse gases (see chapter 1). Long-term records of meteorological \\nobservations show that Germany is impacted by climate change already today (see \\nchapter 3), and it is likely that these impact will be even stronger in future. So far, \\nGermany is hardly prepared for such impacts (see chapter 4 and 6.1). \\nTo reduce our vulnerability, both measures to adapt to impacts of climate change, as \\nwell as measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to abolish the causes of climate change have to be implemented. Adaptation measures to reduce negative impacts and \\nto take advantage of positive impacts are necessary, because climate change is \\nalready taking place, and will continue to happen. Due to the inertia of the climate system, climate change would continue for several centuries even after a highly unlikely immediate reduction of greenhouse gases. Emission reductions are \\nnevertheless indispensable for a long-term reduction of vulnerability. Further warming \\nof our global climate beyond the adaptive capacity of Germany and the world can only \\nbe counteracted by emission reductions. Adaptation measures and emission reduction \\nare therefore not alternative strategies, but have to be carried out in parallel. \\n6.2.2  Adaptation as a Task of Communication \\nIn Germany, outside the scientific community climate change is so far discussed \\nalmost exclusively in the context of the n eed for emission reductions. Adaptation to \\nthe impacts of climate change has only recently received more attention, but is still \\nhighly under-represented in public awareness and in the consciousness of decision-makers in economy, policy and administration (see also chapters 4 and 5). \\nWith regard to this, the first step towards a Germany that is adapted to the impacts of \\nclimate change is to raise awareness of its risks and opportunities – a task of \\ncommunication.  \\nUsing the Existing Awareness of Climate Change \\nAlthough in Germany at the moment it foremost the need for emission reductions that \\nis seen as a necessary response to climate change, the underlying awareness of the \\nexistence of climate change can be used as a basis for communication measures \\ntowards a facilitation of climate adaptation. Particularly in the international comparison, Germany is characterised by a high public awareness of climate change. \\nThis awareness is not limited to global  climate change, but includes the conviction that \\nthere are local impacts of climate change in Germany, as was especially shown during \\nthe Elbe flood 2002 and the heat wave in 2003. This awareness needs to be complemented by the insight that not only emission reductions, but also adaptation to \\nclimate change is necessary. The fact that emission reductions will only become \\neffective in the long-term, and therefore adaptation measures need to be implemented for the short- and medium-term is a very helpful argument. \\nIt should, however, always be stressed that not an either-or strategy, but a parallel \\nimplementation of emission reduction and climate adaptation is needed. Whenever \\nthere are synergies between these two parallel  strategies this needs to be emphasized, \\nsuch as e.g. in the insulation of buildin gs, which reduces energy use and protects \\nagainst heat waves. \\nUsing Extreme Weather Events as Windows of Attention \\nAdaptation to a risk can be seen as a process that starts with an awareness of the risk. Often, this risk awareness cannot be brought about by communication measures that exclusively talk of potential risks in the future. Extreme events, which exemplify the \\nrisks are a crucial trigger for the development of risk awareness. \\nIn Germany, such extreme events, which can be associated with climate change, were \\nprimarily the already mentioned Elbe flood in the summer of 2002, the heat wave in \\nthe summer of 2003, and even the fictive colla pse of the North Atlantic Current in the \\nfilm “The Day After Tomorrow”. The media related these events strongly to climate ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 172}), Document(page_content='- 174 -  \\n change and the necessity of greenhouse gas emission reductions.  \\nFurthermore, extreme events are “windows  of attention” to promote adaptation \\nmeasures with regard to climate change. Besides extreme weather events, there are \\nhardly any windows of attention for climate change, owing to the current economic \\nand social problems in Germany. \\nAn essential prerequisite to using extreme weather events as a means of \\ncommunication to promote climate adaptation is that the necessary concepts of communication are readily available and can be “pulled out of the drawer”. It would \\ntake to much time to develop such concepts after an event, so that the communication \\nmeasure could only be realised when the window of attention has already been closed again. \\nNot only be concepts for communication measures need to be readily available. \\nFurthermore, concepts for concrete adaptation measures that can be rapidly implemented need to be prepared, since extr eme weather events are often followed by \\nan increased readiness to act in decision-makers that will look for suitable measures. \\nIn this way, windows of attention can become windows of opportunity for decisions that would not be taken in the every-day course of events, in which other problems \\nhave higher priority. \\nPromoting Trust Between Science and Society \\nHowever, adaptation to climate change should be more than adaptation to past \\nevents. Since climate change is proceeding further, exclusively adapting to events that \\nhave already occurred would always stay a step behind climate change and its \\nimpacts. For example, the preparation for heat waves should not only take place in such regions that were impacted by the heat wave in 2003. Scientific climate scenarios \\nshow that such heat waves can alos occur in other regions of Germany. Large \\ndamages of climate change can only be avoided if reactive planning of measures and their implementation (!) becomes proactive, and takes into account results from future \\nscenarios. \\nThe trust in analyses of past developments is often larger than in scenarios of the \\nfuture. However, this trust can be increased when trust in the scientists that develop \\nthese scenarios is built. Personal contacts to scientists are often helpful in this. Some \\nscientists appear frequently in the media to council on climate change. These scientists should be encouraged to demand not only the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, \\nbut also the implementation of adaptation measures as adequate responses to climate \\nchange. \\nStressing the Link Between Climate Change and Current Societal \\nProblems \\nProblems besides climate change dominate the public and political debate in Germany \\n(unemployment, demographic development, reform of the welfare state, economic \\ngrowth etc.), as already mentioned when we recommended the use of extreme \\nweather events as windows of attention for communication measures to promote climate adaptation.  \\nMany potential impacts of climate change are directly linked to such problems. After \\nthe Elbe flood 2002 a tax reform to boost economy and employment had to be postponed for a year in order to finance governmental damage reparation payments. \\nWhen temperatures are high, work productivi ty decreases and the mortality of elderly \\nand infirm increases in buildings in which no cooling measures were implemented. As a consequence of the potential increase in ve ctor-borne diseases (e.g. lyme borreliosis), \\nsick leave and health costs increase and further stress the health care system (see \\nchapter 4.5).  \\nHowever, there are also opportunities. For example, productivity in agriculture and \\nforestry may possibly be increased (see chap ters 4.2 and 4.3). Economic growth also \\nseems possible in the tourism sector, particularly at the coasts of the North and Baltic ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 173}), Document(page_content='- 175 -  \\n Sea, when beach tourists look for alternatives to the exceedingly hot Mediterranean \\nregion (see chapter 4.6). \\nRaising awareness of the necessity of adapta tion measures to climate change beyond \\nweather extremes seems possible, when the links between adaptation to climate \\nchange and the problems and challenges that currently receive more societal awareness are communicated clearly. \\nUsing Synergies Between the Adaptation to Climate Change and Other \\nIssues \\nThe recommendation to make use of synergies with other issues is tightly related to \\nthe previous section. This could concern issues that currently receive a lot of attention \\nin Germany (e.g. unemployment). But there are also many issues, particularly preventive measures that currently receive less attention, but would deserve more \\nwith regard to their actual significance. So me of these issues will be exacerbated by \\nclimate change. Two examples are flood prev ention (see chapter 4.1) and preventive \\nmeasures against lyme borreliosis (see chapter 4.5). This issues urgently demand \\naction, even without climate change; and climate change increases this urgency. \\nConflicts regarding attention and resources between these issues should be avoided \\nand synergies should be used. Furthermore, conflicts with institutions that mainly \\nsupport the reduction of greenhouse gas emi ssions should be avoided, and synergies \\nbetween emission reduction and climate adaptation should be emphasized (e.g. insulation of buildings, see above).  \\nCoupling Risk Communication to Communication of Adaptation \\nOptions \\nThe goal of communication of risks and opportunities of climate change is the \\npromotion of adaptation measures. However,  increased awareness of risks will only \\nresult in an increased intention to prevent risks and adapt when adaptation options are \\nseen. Those who do not identify options to adapt will not be forced to act adaptively \\neven by the strongest risk communication. In stead, there will be denial (“Nothing will \\nhappen.”), fatalism (“What ever will be, will be – I cannot do anything against it.”), or pushing off the responsibility to others (“The Government must take care of this.”) \\n(Grothmann & Patt, 2005).  \\nTherefore, the communication of risks of cl imate change should always be coupled to \\nthe communication of concrete and possibly simple adaptation options. For example, if \\nthe goal is to promote the individual preven tive behaviour of inhabitants of flood-prone \\nareas, region-wide maps of flood risk, as were often demanded after the Elbe flood, \\nwill not suffice. Knowing of a risk and being aware of it does not necessarily mean that \\naffected people will implement preventive measures against flood damages. \\nAvoiding Catastrophism \\nIn tight relation to the previous section, the communication of climate change impacts \\nshould not evoke “catastrophism”, since a risk  perception that is too high will quench \\ndamage prevention and lead to problem-avoiding reactions like denial, fatalism, and \\nthe pushing off of responsibilities. In catastrophism, no adaptation options are seen. When catastrophic impacts are anticipated, the perception of lacking adaptation \\noptions is often justified. Drastic examples of possible catastrophes rather evoke \\nfeelings of fear, helplessness and excessive demands, in other cases also defence – thus they result in paralysis rather than stimulating adaptation. To promote adaptation \\nmeasures, films like the disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow”, which depicts a \\nnew ice age on the Northern hemisphere as a consequence of the collapse of the North Atlantic Current, are counterproductive, but might possibly facilitate emission reductions. Also when using extreme weather events as windows of attention to \\npromote climate adaptation – as described above – communication concepts that \\nstress an increased intensity of extreme ev ents without naming possible preventive \\nmeasures should be avoided. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 174}), Document(page_content='- 176 -  \\n Creating Role Models \\nCommunication of risks and adaptation options does not have to be a pure information \\ntransfer. An often much more effective form of communication uses role models. \\nParticularly to communicate possible practical adaptation measures, role models are a very good means. Just as weather extremes can illustrate risks of climate change, role \\nmodels that have successfully adapted to climate change can illustrate possible \\nadaptation measures.  \\nSuch role models can already be found in Germany in various federal states and \\nsectors (see chapter 4). Outside of Germ any adaptation measures have proceeded \\neven further (e.g. United Kingdom). To point out such role models in communication measures conveys not only an impression of possible adaptation measures and their \\nnecessity, but also a certain competitive pressure. \\nCommunicating Uncertainty Openly \\nIn this entire report we emphasize uncerta inty of impacts of climate change through \\nterms like “potential” impacts, “scenarios” or “projections” (not predictions!). In the \\nfollowing sections we will deal with uncertainty in detail: We discuss the sources of uncertainty and the related fact that projections of climate change impacts will always be uncertain, even if scientific methods are further refined (see 6.2.3), and we will \\nshow how justified adaptation decisions can be made despite uncertainty (see 6.2.4). \\nIn this section we will start by discussing the challenge that the uncertainty of climate change impacts poses to communication measures promoting adaptation. \\nMany citizens and decision-makers express a need for certain statements and clear \\ndiagnosis, including equally clear recommendations of therapy. Apparently, this \\nexpectation is particularly aimed at natural scientists, to which climate researchers \\nbelong. On the other hand, the uncertainty of the future is accepted as a matter of course in other aspects of life, and adequate  precautionary measures are taken (e.g. in \\nthe form of insurances). In places, uncertainty is dealt with rather relaxedly and \\nconsciously. \\nThe communication of uncertain impacts of climate change and the necessity of \\nadaptation measures should appeal to this aspect of normality. The future impacts of \\nclimate change are uncertain, just like future illness. Just as people attempt to avoid getting ill by precautionary measures, precaution for the potential impacts of climate \\nchange should be taken. It should be stressed that the impacts are not entirely \\nuncertain, but uncertain within certain ranges. \\nIt is no alternative to avoid the communication of uncertainty; this leads to incredibility \\nwhen concrete predictions are not met. Th e example of the Bank of England shows \\nthat a transparent handling of uncertainty can increase the credibility of an institution. The Bank of England is known for transparent communication of uncertainties in its \\nprojections of economic and currency deve lopment, and is at the same time the \\ninstitution with the highest credibility in England. \\n6.2.3  Adaptation as Decision-Making under Uncertainty \\nTo create awareness of potential impacts of climate change (as discussed in the \\nprevious section), can only be a first step towards a Germany adapted to climate \\nchange. The uncertainty of climate change impacts becomes a challenge, just as in communication of risks and opportunities, when concrete decisions concerning \\nadaptation need to be made – for example the heightening of a dike because of \\nincreased flood risk.  \\nThis uncertainty adds to the large range of uncertain conditions (e.g. economic and \\npolitical development) that decision-maker s are usually faced with. Decision-making \\nunder uncertainty therefore is not a new challenge for most decision-makers, but \\nrather ordinary. Nevertheless, climate change poses a particular challenge with its \\npartially very large ranges of uncertainty, which may range from positive to negative impacts. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 175}), Document(page_content='- 177 -  \\n Unfortunately, uncertainty increases with severity of impact (see Fig. 6-2). For \\nexample, the range of possible precipitatio n changes, which are extremely important \\nfor the water sector, agriculture and forestry, are more uncertain than the expected temperature increases. \\nTemperature Precipitation Extreme weather events\\nGlobal\\nPresence\\nYear\\nClimate changeSeason\\nDirect impactRegional\\nFuture\\nDay\\nIndirect impactSignificance for adaptation\\nUncertainty\\nTemperature Precipitation Extreme weather events\\nGlobal\\nPresence\\nYear\\nClimate changeSeason\\nDirect impactRegional\\nFuture\\nDay\\nIndirect impactSignificance for adaptation\\nUncertainty\\nTemperature Precipitation Extreme weather events\\nGlobal\\nPresence\\nYear\\nClimate changeSeason\\nDirect impactRegional\\nFuture\\nDay\\nIndirect impactSignificance for adaptation\\nUncertainty\\n \\nFig. 6-2: Uncertainty increases with the severity of the impacts of climate change. \\nHowever, waiting for less uncertain results before implementing adaptation measures \\nto climate change is an irresponsible st rategy in the sense of the precautionary \\nprinciple, since climate change and its impacts will not wait to occur until we understand them fully. Also, waiting for less uncertain results is a treacherous hope, \\nsince even with further refined scientific me thods, future results will remain uncertain. \\nThe future greenhouse gas emissions, which are an essential cause of climate change, and the only partially known effects of these emissions on the climate system will \\nremain sources of uncertainty. Binding long-term (!) international contacts can reduce \\nthe uncertainty caused by uncertain gree nhouse gas emissions. Improved regional \\nclimate models could reduce the uncertainties  in the reactions of the climate system. \\nWith regard to the precautionary principle, it is a very dangerous strategy to agree on \\none emission scenario and one climate model, in order to reduce the range of uncertainty in the results on impacts of cl imate change – an alternative suggested by \\nsome German political actors. We lack the knowledge to do such a selection, which \\ncould lead to the masking of possible worst-case developments. Both sources of uncertainty, future greenhouse gas emission  trajectories and understanding of the \\nclimate system, are explicitly addressed in this study by using various emission \\nscenarios and different climate moclels (see chapter 2), so that ranges of results are given for each estimated indicator.  \\nThe uncertainty of impacts of climate change often becomes a crucial obstacle for \\nadaptation measures, as became apparent in the survey with experts from functional departments of federal states (see chapter 4), in the “Expert Talks on Climate” \\n(Klimafachgespräche), which were organised by the Federal Environment Agency \\n(UBA), and in the Stakeholder-Workshop we conducted during this study (see chapter 5). We found that there often was a lack of knowledge about systematic and conscious \\nstrategies to make decisions under uncertainty, and that therefore the already \\ndescribed strategies of waiting for less uncertain studies or automatic psychological ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 176}), Document(page_content='- 178 -  \\n mechanisms (wishful thinking, denial of the risks, “the truth lies somewhere in \\nbetween”, etc.) came into play. \\nThere seems to be a need for support on how to reach well-founded adaptation \\ndecisions despite existing uncertainty. This need is met in the following section. Here \\nwe introduce a decision support system that was particularly developed to tackle the issue of uncertainty in climate change and describes the entire process from \\nclarification of goals and interests, over the choice of adaptation measures, to their \\nimplementation and control. \\n6.2.4  Eight-Stage Decision Support System for the \\nAdaptation to Climate Change \\nThis study can only provide a coarse overview of the risks and opportunities of climate \\nchange and suitable adaptation measures. It offers useful, but not sufficient knowledge \\nfor adaptation decisions in specific regions of Germany or a specifically impacted \\nenterprise.  \\nDecisions always depend on the goals, interests and values of the decision-maker. The \\nclimate impacts, and also the adaptation measures can be judged very differently. For example, the assessment of vulnerability of the nature conservation sector in this \\nstudy was especially difficult, since it depe nds highly on the goals of the conservation \\nof biodiversity. Vulnerability needs to be ra ted as high if the conservation of present \\nlevel species richness is the goal; because of climate change (especially consequent \\nshifts in species distribution) and the lack of adaptation measures this goal cannot be \\nreached. The rating becomes more moderate, if a change in species composition is accepted. \\n \\nFig 6-3: Eight-stage concept for decisions on adaptation to climate change (source: \\nWillows & Connel, 2003, p. 7) \\nIn the end, every decision-maker needs to go through the same process of evaluating \\nthe impacts of climate change and suitable ad aptation measures in their specific field \\nof interest and region, as exercised in this study for various climate-sensitive sectors ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 177}), Document(page_content='- 179 -  \\n in Germany by scientists. \\nA decision-maker even has to go further, since she/he has to reach decisions on \\nadaptation, implement them and monitor their success despite the existing \\nuncertainties of the concrete impacts of climate change. \\nThe United Kingdom Climate Impact Programme (UKCIP) commissioned an 8-stage \\ndecision support system to structure this decision process (see Fig. 6-3), with special \\nregard of the uncertainties of climate change impacts. In the following we give an overview of this 8-stage concept, linking it to the methods and results of this study to \\nillustrate the opportunities of integrating ou r results into the decision-making process. \\nA detailed description with concrete guiding questions, methods and techniques can be found in Willows and Connel (2003). \\nGeneral Features of the Decision Concept \\nThe decision concept is a flexible  approach to make decisions about the adaptation to \\nuncertain impacts of climate change, and is suitable for decisions made in administrations, enterprises, as well as non-governmental organisations and private \\nhouseholds: \\n• It is circular . The performance of adaptation decisions is reviewed and revisited \\nthrough time in light of new insights, and new adaptation decisions are taken if \\nnecessary. \\n• It is iterative : The decision support system contains feedback loops to earlier \\nstages in the decision-making in various places, in order to allow new insights to \\nbe taken into account, even when the decision-making process has already begun. These iterations are important to yield robust decisions in the unknown decision \\nfield of climate change adaptation. \\n• Specific parts of the decision (stages 3, 4 and 5) are tiered : Prior to detailed \\nanalyses of risks, opportunities and adaptation measures, the decision-maker can \\nscreen, evaluate and prioritise them and w ill proceed with the analysis only when \\nthey are important or suitable. \\nThe decision concept stresses the importance of taking into account the interests of \\nstakeholders and impacted groups . Wherever possible, these people should be actively \\nengaged in the decision process. Besides other advantages, involving stakeholders and \\nimpacted groups decreases the danger of overlooking important impacts of climate \\nchange and obstacles for the implementation of adaptation measures. Moreover, differences in values and interests can be identified and sustainable solutions can be \\nfound and yield compromises that are supported by large groups. It has been shown in \\nthe past that impacted groups will suppo rt even disagreeable decisions when they \\nwere engaged in the decision-making process. \\nStage 1: Identify Problem and Objectives \\nIn the first stage of the decision concept the problem, the objectives of the decision and the further context of the decision are identified. The context of how a problem developed often determines also part of the decision. The need to make a decision \\nmay arise from a range of factors, including: the development of a new product or \\nproject, changes in legislation or policy, regu lar reviews of existing activities, pressure \\nfrom interest groups, or information about the impacts of climate change. \\nClimate change can be the crucial trigger fo r the decision process. The main trigger \\ncan also be another issue, and climate change plays a subdued role. \\nThe objectives of the decision can be conservation goals. We have already discussed \\nthe significance of conservation goals in the nature conservation sector. This difficulty also arises in other sectors, e.g. agricultur e ,  f o r e s t r y  a n d  t o u r i s m .  I f  t h e  g o a l  i s  t o  \\nconserve today’s cultural landscape with its current composition of species and \\nvarieties, the evaluation of climate change is far more negative as if the goal is to conserve or create diverse landscapes. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 178}), Document(page_content='- 180 -  \\n The interests of stakeholders and impacted groups need to be taken into account \\nparticularly when identifying the decision objectives. Whenever possible, they should \\nbe actively engaged in the decision process. \\nIf there is uncertainty, the problem should be  formulated as open as possible, so that \\ndecision options will not be lost at early stages in the decision-making process. \\nStage 2: Establish Decision-Making Criteria, Receptors, Exposure \\nUnits and Risk Assessment Endpoints \\nThe objectives of the decision identified in stage 1 (e.g. mitigation of the impacts of \\nheat waves) are translated into operational decision-making criteria (e.g. reduction of \\nheat wave related fatalities by 50% relative to 2003 by 2010), which are used as \\nbenchmarks for reviewing risks and adaptation measures. \\nFurthermore, the decision-maker – often suppo rted by a risk-analyst who will evaluate \\nthe risks and measures in stages 3 to 5 – should decide upon the following, as a preparation of the review process: \\n• Exposure units (e.g. regions, enterprise s) that the evaluation of risks and \\nmeasures is concerned with. \\n• Receptors within these exposure units (e.g. a specific group of citizens, a specific \\nsensitive species). \\n• Risk Assessment Endpoints (e.g. 90% certainty of reduction of heat wave related \\nfatalities by 50% relative to 2003 by 2010) \\nStage 3: Assess Risk and Opportunities \\nThe third stage in the decision-making proc ess identifies the risks and opportunities \\nthrough climate change and other developments. In contrast to the concept of Willows and Connel (2003) we suggest to take opportuni ties into account, in addition to risks. \\nTo capitalize on opportunities, decisions on adaptation measures have to be made also \\n(for example, the opportunity to host more  summer tourists at the North and Baltic \\nSea owing to exceedingly hot temperatures at the Mediterranean Sea).  \\nThe risk and opportunity assessment has a number of levels (tiers). Prior to detailed \\nanalysis it is suggested to screen, evaluate and prioritise the risks and opportunities, and to continue with the detailed quantitative analysis only when ranked as important.  \\nScenarios of potential impacts of climate change as introduced in this study (see \\nchapters 3, 4 and 6.1) are a crucial source of information to screen and evaluate risks \\nand opportunities. The same qualitative scale that was used in the experts’ survey on \\nrisk and opportunity assessment during this study (very negative – negative – slightly negative – neither positive nor negative – slightly positive – positive – very positive; see chapter 2.6) can be used for the identification of particularly important risks and \\nopportunities, but also to reveal different evaluations within a decision committee. \\nExamples for such assessments in various climate-sensitive sectors and environmental zones of Germany can be found in the sub-chapters of chapter 4, in the section \\n“Impacts of Climate Change – A ssessment by Regional Experts”. \\nStage 4: Identifying possible Adaptation Measures \\nIn the fourth stage of the decision-making process, possible adaptation measures are \\nidentified, to mitigate the risks and capitalize on the opportunities characterized in \\nstage 3, and to fulfil the decision criteria formulated in stage 2. \\nThe decision-maker should particularly seek “no-regret” and “low-regret” options. With \\nthese options, uncertainty is low or inexistent. They bring advantages, independent of \\nwhich of the future scenarios of climate change and other developments will occur. In many cases, such options will not be available and alternative decision rules will have \\nto be applied. \\nStage 5: Appraise Adaptation Measures ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 179}), Document(page_content='- 181 -  \\n The adaptive measures identified in stage 4 are specifically evaluated in stage 5. To \\nidentify the most favourable options, the same dimensions of evaluation can be used as were applied during the expe rts’ survey of this study on the appraisal of adaptation \\nmeasures (see chapter 2.6): \\n• Effectiveness  of various measures, to mitigate risks, and capitalize on \\nopportunities of climate change and with regards to other economic, social and \\necological prospects. Rule: “Choose the measures of broad effectiveness; since \\nthese make most sense with regard to possibly only partly known impacts of \\nclimate change.” \\n• Present degree of implementation  of measures. Often measures have already been \\nimplemented for other reasons that are also suitable to adapt to climate change, \\nand need only to be adjusted to changing conditions due to climate change. Rule: \\n“Choose measures that are already partially implemented; since the costs of \\nimplementation of such measures are often lower than of new measures.” \\n• Complexity and obstacles  of the implementation of the measures (financial, \\norganisational, legislative, lacking knowledge, others obstacles). Again, stakeholder and impacted groups should be involved in this, to elicit the \\nacceptance of the various measures, Rule: “Choose the measure of lowest complexity and facing the smallest obstacles.” \\nExamples for the appraisal of adaptation measures in various climate-sensitive sectors \\nand environmental zones of Germany can be fo und in the sub-chapters of chapter 4, in \\nthe section “4.4.7 Effectiveness, Degr ee of Implementation and Obstacles of \\nAdaptation: Assessment of Regional Experts”. \\nEspecially in this fifth stage of the decisi on support system, the problem of uncertainty \\nis addressed. Here, a recapturing of economic decision theory is necessary. It \\ndifferentiates two types of decisions under uncertainty: \\n1. Decisions taken under precise uncertainty : The probability of the potentially \\noccurring environmental condition is known (stochastic decision model). \\n2. Decisions taken under uncertainty : The environmental condition that may occur is \\nknow, but not its probability of occurrence. \\nThe latter types of decision need to be taken for most potential impacts of climate \\nchange. On the basis of multiple emission scenarios and climate models a range of \\npotential impacts is simulated, but it is impossible to attach a probability to any of \\nthese scenarios. Therefore decisions on the adaptation to climate change are mostly \\ndecisions under uncertainty. For decisions under uncertainty, economic decision theory \\nidentifies rules, which allow a systematic and founded decision-making process despite \\nuncertainty. These rules are listed in Box 6-1. \\nStage 6: Making a Decision about Adaptation Measures \\nIn stage 6 of the decision support system the decision, which adaptation measure will \\nbe implemented, in what form, and when is taken.  \\nIn some cases, stages 3 to 5 reveal that the criteria formulated in stage 2 are not \\nsufficient or not suitable to make a decision (e.g. because unexpected risks have \\nemerged). Then the decision criteria have to be revised, and stages 3 to 5 have to be run through again, using the revised criteria. \\nSometimes it may become apparent during stages 3-5 that the problem as such was \\ninsufficiently identified, so that stage one has to be revisited and the problem has to \\nbe characterised more sufficiently. \\nStage 7: Implementing the Adaptation Decision \\nIn the seventh stage, the decision taken in stage 6 is implemented practically. Willows \\nand Connell (2003) do not describe stages 7 and 8 in detail within their decision \\nconcept. However, many studies and recomme ndations on this can be found in the \\nscientific literature on organisations and policy. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 180}), Document(page_content='- 182 -  \\n It is in general sensible to accompany the implementation of measures with \\ncommunication measures, addressing the wider public. If uncertainty played an important role in the decision-making process,  this should be communicated clearly, to \\nprevent public blame in case the implemente d measure fails in the sense of under- or \\nover-adapting to climate change or other developments. \\nBox 6-1 – Rules for Decision-Making under Uncertainty (v. Zwehl, 1993) \\nMaxiMin-Rule  (choice of the alternative with the maximal minimum) / pessimism- \\nprinciple: Only the worst event is regarded that occurs as a consequence of the \\nimplementation of a specific adaptation measure under the possible environmental \\nconditions is regarded. Alternative adapta tion measures are compared only on the \\ngrounds of their worst outcome. \\nMaxiMax-Rule (choice of the alternative with the maximal ma ximum) / optimism-\\nprinciple: Each adaptation measure is appraised only on the grounds of the outcome \\nthat is produced under the environmental conditions that is best for this alternative. \\nCritique : Both rules do not consider all possible outcomes of an alternative adaptation \\nmeasure, but focus on the best (MaxiMax) or worst (MaxiMin) result. \\nHurwicz-Rule : Allows compromises between pessimistic and optimistic decision rules, \\nbecause the decision-maker can express his/her personal and subjective attitude \\nthrough the so-called “parameter of optimism”.  \\nCritique : The Hurwicz-rule also does not co nsider all possible outcomes of an \\nalternative adaptation measure, but appraises the alternatives using a weighted mean \\nof their best and worst outcomes. \\nLaplace-Rule:  All possible outcomes receive the same probability. The alternative, \\nwhich then promises the best outcome is chosen. \\nSavage-Niehans-Rule / Minimax-Regret-Rule : The appraisal of the alternatives is \\nnot based directly on their outcomes, but on the respective degrees of regret. The \\nalternative that minimises potential regret, which is suffered through the lack of \\nknowledge of the true course of the world, is chosen (rule of the smallest regret). \\n \\nStage 8: Monitoring the Implementation and Effectiveness of the \\nMeasure \\nTo evaluate if the implementation of the adaptation measure succeeds as planned and \\nthe anticipated effectiveness is achieved systematic monitoring is necessary. A process \\nevaluation should be conducted, in order to appraise not only the effectiveness of the measure after implementation (evaluation of effectiveness), but also to reveal unexpected obstacles for implementation.  \\nFor this evaluation the dimensions already used in stage 5 can be used again: \\n• Effectiveness  of the measure to mitigate risks, and capitalize on opportunities of \\nclimate change and with regards to other economic, social and ecological \\nprospects.  \\n• Degree of implementation  of the measure.  \\n• Complexity and obstacles  of the implementation of the measures (financial, \\norganisational, legislative, lacking knowledge, others obstacles).  \\nIf the monitoring or other information (e.g. new climate scenarios) results in the \\nnecessity of a new identification of problems and objectives, the decision-making \\nprocess starts again from stage 1. \\n6.2.5  Adaptation as a Challenge to Society \\nThe decision-making process described in the previous section ultimately has to be ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 181}), Document(page_content='- 183 -  \\n performed in all sectors, regions, and organisations in Germany that are impacted by \\nclimate change. As stressed several times, stakeholders and impacted groups should be involved in the decision-making process. \\nOften the adaptation to climate change will be achieved through a partitioning of \\nresponsibility between various actors. Therefore, in many cases stakeholders and impacted groups will not only be involved in the decision-making process, but also in \\nthe implementation of adaptation measures.  \\nThe adaptation to climate change needs to  b e  u n d e r s t o o d  a s  a  t a s k  f o r  t h e  w h o l e  \\nsociety, just as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Every citizen, as well as \\nactors from economy, policy, administration, media, environmental organisations, education and research can and should contribute to this task. \\nClearly adaptation will not always be achieved in cooperation, but also in competition \\nbetween actors (e.g. between different companies), and pushing off of responsibility may play a role (e.g. to the government). Pa rticularly the pushing off of responsibility \\ntoward the government should be avoided, with regard to the financial situation of \\ncommunities, federal states and the federati on. Private personal responsibility and a \\njust and efficient sharing of responsibilities between state and society should be \\ndemanded and supported. \\nScience and Education \\nScience and education play an essential role in the facilitation of adaptation to climate \\nchange, owing to the complexity of the climate issue. Scientists and teachers should \\npossibly not only convey concrete knowledge on potential impacts of climate change in \\nGermany, but should to a certain extent be able to name possible adaptation measures \\nto these impacts. This applies especially when they appear in the mass media, and it \\ncannot be expected that the audience or readers know of possible adaptation \\nmeasures, so that they can develop feelings of fear or helplessness (see also section 6.2.2). \\nMedia \\nBesides science and education, the media play a crucial role in conveying potential climate impacts and necessary adaptation measures. The previous focus on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as necessary response to climate change needs to be \\ncomplemented by climate adaptation. However,  it should always be stressed that not \\nan either-or strategy, but a parallel implementation of emission reduction and climate adaptation is needed. The uncertainties in impacts of climate change should be \\ncommunicated, their sources explained (see 6.2.3), and it should be made clear how \\nuncertainties could be dealt with (see 6.2.4). \\nPolicy and Administration \\nPolicy and administration have to create the necessary financial, legislative and \\norganisational conditions to adapt to climate change. Moreover, policy and \\nadministration are themselves actors in adaptation measures. This report contains concrete results on effectiveness, degree of implementation, obstacles and complexity \\nof adaptation measures in governmental institutions in the climate-sensitive sectors \\nforestry, agriculture, water, tourism, natu re conservation, health and transport (see \\nchapter 4). \\nThe administration also needs to facilitate adaptation measures in the private sector \\nand households by providing information and coordination. This is of special \\nimportance regarding the financial situation in many communities, federal states and \\nthe federation. It is important to support and coordinate adaptation measures in \\nregions and sectors through information on potential regional or sectoral impacts of climate change and possible adaptation strategies (see 6.2.2). Public-private \\npartnerships are a useful option to finance specific projects of adaptation. In this \\nrespect, the Centre of Competence for Climate Impacts planned by the Federal Environmental Agency as a central platform for information on climate impacts and ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 182}), Document(page_content='- 184 -  \\n possible adaptation measures in Germany will be a very welcome resource. \\nPrivate Sector and Households \\nBesides the climate-sensitive sectors analysed in this study (forestry, agriculture, \\nwater management, tourism, nature conserva tion, health, and transport), also other \\nsectors are impacted by climate change, e.g. the construction sector and finance \\n(banks and insurances). The latter plays a central role in the facilitation of adaptation measures in the entire economy. Finance holds an important instrument in the \\ngranting of credits and insurances, and even today the analysis of climate and weather \\nrisks play a decisive role particularly in large investments. \\nMoreover, the adaptation of every single German citizen is called for, e.g. with \\nincreased precaution against tick bites (see chapter 4.5), when building a house in the \\nprecaution against heat waves (see chapter 4. 5) or against increased flood risk (see \\nchapter 4.1). \\nNature Conservation and Environmental Organisations \\nIn the past, environmental organisations have played a crucial role in raising public awareness concerning climate change. As a necessary response to climate change they have in the past primarily demanded greenhouse gas emission reductions. Often they \\nhave opposed adaptation to climate change as unsustainable strategy, since some \\nrepresentatives of economy and some nation s propagated it as an alternative to \\nemission reduction.  \\nIt is important to gain support of environmental organisation also for climate \\nadaptation, since climate change proceeds and adaptation is a short- and medium-\\nterm necessity in addition to emission reductions. In addition to their previous role in \\nraising awareness of climate change and th e necessity of emission reductions, they \\ncould play a central role in communicating necessary adaptation measures, since they \\nhost considerable knowledge about the climate system. \\nIn the nature conservation sector, which will undergo significant changes through \\nclimate change, nature conservation organisations are very important. They can play a \\ncentral role in promoting the necessary societal dialogue on conservation goals in \\nGerman nature conservation.  \\nCrating Networks \\nThe dialogue and coordination between different adaptation actors from economy, policy, administration, society, media, environmental organisations, education and research should be promoted, since adaptation to climate change is a task for the whole society.  \\nNetworking is a very suitable means to promote mutual learning and sharing of \\nresponsibilities, and was explicitly asked for by participants of the stakeholder-\\nworkshop conducted within this study (see chapter 5). Such networks should not only \\nbe build within Germany, but should get in contact with other countries, since some of these have vastly larger experiences with adaptation to climate change than Germany. \\nHere not only the United Kingdom with their central “United Kingdom Climate Impact \\nProgramme (UKCIP)” needs to be named, bu t also the so-called developing countries, \\nwhich have a particular head start with respect to promoting private damage prevention against weather extremes. \\nGermany has already begun to build an actors-network through the efforts of the \\nFederal Environmental Agency to build a Centre of Competence for Climate Impacts, \\nwhich also seeks cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (see \\nchapter 5). Further complementary initiatives already exist in some federal states. \\nFurther financial and organisational support of this actors-network through \\ngovernmental and increasingly private sources would be desirable, since such networks provide necessary information for vulnerability assessments, and also \\nconstitute communication platforms for coordinated adaptation measures.

There are direct effects of  global change on human beings (e.g., by \\nfloods or heat waves), and indirect effects through impacts of global change on climate-sensitive sectors (e.g., water management or agriculture). \\nVulnerability to present and future global change is highly dependent on the initial \\nsituation. Often a region or sector is under pressure already today. Current climatic or \\nlocal environmental conditions can impose restrictions (e.g., low precipitation or poor \\nsoils limit agriculture and forestry). Many sectors are affected by changes in socio-economic circumstances (e.g., agriculture, fo restry, health, tourism, transport). Such \\ncircumstances determine to a large extent the predisposition of a region or sector to \\nimpacts of global change and are largely resp onsible for the regional differentiation of \\nvulnerability. \\nIn addition to this predisposition, the vulnerability of a human-environment system, a \\nregion or sector to global change depends mainly on three factors: \\n• What is the degree of climate change and other elements of global change in the \\nspecific region? \\n• What are the potential impacts of global change in the region on the different \\nsectors? \\n• What is the degree of adaptation of the specific sectors within the region to these \\npotential impacts? \\nThe degree of adaptation is determined by  the presence of adaptation measures, \\nwhich can prevent damage or make use of favourable opportunities.  \\nThe assumption of an unchanged state of adaptation in the future results in a \\nvulnerability without  further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario). This vulnerability \\nis also described as the current vulnerability . In determining this vulnerability it is \\nassumed that in addition to the existing measures (e.g., in flood protection) no further \\nmeasures will be taken in the future. The current vulnerability gives an idea of the ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 185}), Document(page_content='- 187 -  \\n damage that has to be expected if no further adaptation measures to global change \\n(particularly climate change) are taken. In this study the current vulnerability is presented on a qualitative scale with th ree categories (small – medium – high \\nvulnerability). A quantitative vulnerability index is deliberately avoided, since such an \\nindex would pretend a precision that does not exist – neither with regard to potential \\nimpacts of global change nor concerning the adaptation to such impacts. \\nThe assumption of a fully used existing adaptive capacity in order to improve the \\nfuture degree of adaptation results in a vulnerability with further adaptation \\n(improved-business scenario). As before, the vulnerability with further adaptation is \\nassessed on a qualitative scale with three categories (small – medium – high \\nvulnerability). Comparison of the vulnerability without further adaptation (business-as-\\nusual scenario) and the vulnerability with further adaptation (improved-business \\nscenario) renders an idea of the damage from global change (particularly from climate \\nchange) with and without further adaptation.  \\nTherefore, vulnerability of a human-environment  system exists only if this system is \\nnot adapted to the potential impacts of global change. The degree of adaptation is \\ndetermined by the adaptive capacity of the human-environment system. The adaptive \\ncapacity is small if the necessary resources (financial, organisational, legislative, \\nknowledge, etc.) to implement a sufficient degree of adaptation are lacking. In this \\ncase the human-environment system will not be able to adapt to the impacts of global change.  \\nMethods \\nIn order to reach the objectives stated above we relied on the results of a European research project (ATEAM\\n29), which was coordinated by PIK. These results are based on \\na set of consistent, spatially explicit scenarios of global change, a range of ecosystem \\nmodels and indicators for ecosystem services, as well as a continuous dialogue with \\nstakeholders. The bulk of scientific information on global change and its potential impacts in this report is drawn from analyses of the results of the ATEAM project. In addition to the ATEAM results, numerous studies and projects on national and regional \\nscale were consulted. \\nTo gain estimations of the regional and sector-specific significance of potential impacts \\nof climate change, of the existing degree of adaptation and of suitable adaptation \\nmeasures, surveys of climate-sensitive sectors (forestry, agriculture, water management, tourism, nature conservation, health, and transport) were carried out in \\nvarious regions of Germany. \\nTo assess vulnerability, the scenarios of pote ntial impacts of global change in Germany \\n(from the ATEAM and other projects) were in tegrated with results from the surveys. \\nThe results were discussed during several “Expert Talks on Climate” \\n(Klimafachgespräche) which were organised by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) \\nand during a stakeholder workshop with representatives from government, \\nadministrative bodies, the economy, and the wider public. \\nGlobal Climate Change – Historical Development \\nThe rate and degree of climate change, whic h took place during the 20th century are \\nunprecedented – for example the current temperatures on the Northern Hemisphere are probably the warmest for at least 2000 years. The 1990s were the warmest \\ndecade, and the years 1998, 2002 and 2003 were the three warmest years in the last \\nthousand years in the Northern Hemisphere. Since 1900 the global mean temperature \\nhas risen by 0.7 ± 0.2 °C. Precipitation over the middle and high latitudes of the \\nNorthern Hemisphere increased by 0.5 to 1% per decade in the 20\\nth century, while it \\ndecreased over the subtropical latitudes.  Furthermore, climate extremes were \\n                                               \\n29 ATEAM – Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling (EU Project No. \\nEVK2-2000-00075), www.pi k-potsdam.de/ATEAM.

Since 1950, there has been a pronounced increase in the damage caused by natural disasters and flooding. \\nOnly a small fraction of this climate change can be explained by natural factors such as \\neruptions of volcanoes, changes in solar activity or deviations in the Earth’s orbit \\naround the sun. In the scientific community there is overwhelming consensus that the \\nmain cause of climate change is human activity, in particular the emission of greenhouse gases. In a few generations we are using up fossil fuels that took \\nhundreds of millions of years to form, in order to meet our energy demands. Burning \\nof fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases, e.g. carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO\\n2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) reflect \\npart of Earth’s heat radiation (infrared radiation) and thereby cause a “greenhouse \\neffect” that is warming the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. \\nSince the beginning of industrialisation the atmospheric concentration of the most \\nimportant greenhouse gas CO 2 has risen by 34% from 280 to 375 ppm, due to burning \\nof fossil fuels and land-use change, and has probably reached its highest level in 400’000 years. Over the same time the concentration of methane, the second most \\nimportant greenhouse gas, has even risen by more than 150%. In the absence of \\ndrastic measures to reduce emissions, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is expected to double even within the next few decades (to almost 600 ppm, relative to pre-industrial level). \\nGlobal Climate Change – Projections of Future Development \\nThe European Union is committed to keeping global warming below 2ºC, relative to pre-industrial temperatures, in order to prevent “dangerous clime change” (see Article \\n2 of the UNFCCC). Climate sensitivity, that  is the rise in temperature following a \\ndoubling of the CO\\n2 concentration, is assumed to lie between 1.5 and 4.5ºC globally. \\nThe probability of overshooting the 2-degree target in the long term rises rapidly \\nunder concentrations that lie much higher than today’s values. To reach the 2-degree \\ntarget, today’s global emissions need to be lowered from 7 Gt carbon per year to 2 Gt \\nper year. This is a formidable challenge, in view of the emissions of the United States \\nof America and of densely populated countri es such as India and China that also \\nexhibit rapid economic growth. The projecti on of emission trajectories is very \\nuncertain. In this study we use the SRES scenarios published by the IPCC. They do not consider any explicit climate policy, but nevertheless embrace a range of emissions \\nthat are possible in the light of today’s climate policy strategies. \\nThe IPCC acts on the assumption of the continued increase of all greenhouse gas \\nconcentrations to values of between 650 and 1215 ppm CO\\n2 equivalents. The carbon \\ndioxide concentration alone will therefore ri se to values of between 607 and 958 ppm, \\nranging between a doubling and a tripling of pre-industrial levels. In consequence, a continued, accelerated rise in global mean temperature by 1.4-5.8ºC is expected by \\nthe year 2100. Global average precipitation is expected to rise slightly, with a very \\nheterogeneous distribution over space and time. \\nThe exact prediction of extreme clime events is currently impossible. However, \\nextreme weather and climate events, such as hot summer days, summer drought and extreme rainfall will probably or very probably occur more frequently during the 21\\nst \\ncentury. Moreover an increase in cyclone activity in the tropics is likely. A decrease in \\ncold extremes is very likely.  \\nGlobal Change in Germany – Historical Trends in Climate  \\nLong-term weather recording shows that Germany is already affected by climate \\nchange. Regarding temperature  development, the 1990s were observed to be the \\nwarmest decade in Germany during the 20th century, in accordance to the global \\nobservation. The annual average temperatur e increased by ca. 0.8 to 1ºC between \\n1900 and 2000. However, this warming did not occur linearly. A strong warming up to \\n1911 was followed by a heterogeneous period. The 1940s were exceptionally warm. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 187}), Document(page_content='- 189 -  \\n After a cooling trend up to the 1970s we now observe a continuous and rapid \\ntemperature increase that still continues today. There is strong regional variation. In the last decade (1990s), the temperature rise in southern and south-western Germany was exceptionally strong. Observations on seasonal trends in the warming depend on \\nperiod in time and method. During the last twenty years a trend toward stronger \\ntemperature increase in winter than in summer has been observed. For example, the temperature increase in the winter months in Germany during the period between \\n1981 and 2000 was 2.3ºC, while in the summer months it was merely 0.7ºC. \\nPrecipitation  in Germany is characterised by strong regional and seasonal variations. \\nIn the long term, neither the average values nor the seasonal or regional distribution \\nshow significant trends. During the last 100 years there has been a small trend towards increased winter precipitation, but this trend is not significant. In the last 30 years, however, there was indeed a definite increase in winter precipitation. Summer \\nprecipitation in contrast showed little change. \\nChanges in the duration of snow cover  are also relevant. Since 1950, a decrease by \\n30-40% in the duration of snow cover has been observed in altitudes below 300m in \\nBavaria and Baden-Württemberg. In the medium altitudes (300-800m) the decrease was 10-20%. In higher altitudes over 800m only small decreases and in places even \\nincreases were observed, due to increased winter precipitation and sufficiently low \\ntemperatures for snowfall. \\nThere is only partial evidence for an increase in climate extremes , such as heat waves, \\nextreme rainfalls and storms. Extreme heat events , s uc h as  h e at d ays  (T>3 0 ºC) or \\nh e a t  w a v e s  ( i n t e r v a l s  o f  m o r e  t h a n  t h ree days during which the maximum daily \\ntemperature lies above a certain high threshold, relative to the specific temperature \\nstandard of the weather station) exhibit a definite trend. For example, the probability \\nof occurrence of heat days in the months of July and August has risen over the last one hundred, and especially markedly during  the last twenty years at almost all \\nweather stations in Germany. The intensity and frequency of occurrence of extreme \\nrainfall events  have increased especially during the last forty years of the 20\\nth century. \\nIn general, this trend is more pronounced in the winter than in the summer. The intensity and frequency of occurrence of squalls  have also been in vestigated. However, \\nat present no statistically significant tr end can be found. There is a tendency of \\nincreased probability of occurrence of extremely high daily wind speed maxima (Bft > 8) during winter (with the exception of co astal regions), and decreased occurrence of \\nsuch maxima in summer (with the exception of southern Germany). \\nGlobal change in Germany – Scenarios of Future Climate Change  \\nWith regard to future temperature development, all ATEAM scenarios that were \\nanalysed in this study exhibit a definite warming trend for Germany. The range of \\nwarming of the long-term annual average temp eratures up to the year 2080 within the \\nseven climate scenarios considered was +1 .6 to +3.8ºC. Many scenarios show a \\nparticularly strong warming in the south-west, in some cases also in the far east of \\nGermany. The scenarios exhibit heteroge neous seasonal changes. The trend of \\nstronger warming during winter, observed in the past, cannot be found in the future scenarios. \\nAll climate scenarios show very small changes in annual  precipitation,  which lie mostly \\nbelow 10% up to the year 2080. Stronger trends can be found in winter and summer \\nprecipitation. All seven climate scenarios show an increase in winter precipitation, \\nwhile most scenarios show a decrease in summer precipitation. This is in accordance with the observed trend of a shift of precipitation into the winter half year. An especially pronounced increase in winter precipitation was projected for Southern \\nGermany, at least in the scenarios that are based on the climate model HadCM3. In \\nthese scenarios, the decrease of summer precipitation is concentrated on Southwest Germany (Rhineland) and central parts of Eastern Germany. However, the projections \\nof the other climate models partly produce regionally contradicting trends.

The lowest vulnerability is assessed for the German low mountain ranges and Northwest Germany. \\nIn Eastern Germany  (North-Eastern lowland, South-Eastern basin and hills), low water \\navailability and the risk of summer droughts account for the high current vulnerability in many sectors. The present unfavourable climatic water balance will be exacerbated \\nby the already observed and further expected decrease in summer precipitation, as \\nwell as by increased evaporation due to increased temperatures. This will in particular impact agriculture and forestry, as well as the transport sector (navigation). \\nAdditionally, there is a high vulnerability with respect to flooding in the large river \\nbasins of the Elbe and Oder. In the Lausitz, where particularly high summer temperatures are expected, the current vulnerability in the health sector is high, owing \\nto strong heat stress.   \\nIn Southwest Germany  (upper Rhine rift) especially the high temperatures will cause \\nproblems. This region, where the highest temperatures are measured today, is \\nexpected to show the strongest warming in Germany in the future. This causes high \\nvulnerability without  further adaptation in the health sector. Furthermore, agriculture \\nand forestry are highly vulnerable to rapid warming. Moreover, the risk of flooding in \\nthe early spring increases, owing to a shift of precipitation from summer to winter, as \\nwell as an increase in extreme rainfall events. \\nThe sensitivity of many sectors is the main reason for the high vulnerability without  \\nfurther adaptation in the Alps, in addition to expected climate change, which is slightly \\nabove average in the Alpine region. Especial ly in the nature conservation sector, the \\nAlps are very vulnerable, because they are characterised by many endemic plant and \\nanimal species, which hardly have any migratory alternatives when climate changes. \\nFurthermore, the abundance of unique microclimatic locations and azonal biotopes increases vulnerability. In the Alps the risk of flooding is particularly high, owing to the \\nlack of retention areas. Finally, the winter tourism sector is highly sensitive and not \\nvery adaptive to a decrease in snow safety.  \\nIn comparison, the German low mountain ranges  currently show medium vulnerability. \\nAt present the climate in these regions is cool and moist, so that a change to a warmer climate can actually pose an opportunity for some sectors (e.g. agriculture). There is \\nhigh vulnerability against flooding, especially for local high water events, caused by \\nconvective extreme rainfall events. Winter to urism, if present, also shows high current \\nvulnerability. \\nSimilar to the low mountain ranges, the coastal regions  exhibit only medium \\nvulnerability. However, there is high current vulnerability caused by possibly more intensive storm surges. Moreover, the immediate coastal areas are threatened by the \\nrising sea level. But the implementation of  adaptation measures has already advanced \\nrelatively far. In other sectors coastal regions may well profit from climate change. This concerns the sectors agriculture and forestry, as well as tourism, which will profit \\nfrom rising summer temperatures an d decreasing summer precipitation. \\nThe lowest current vulnerability was assessed for Northwest Germany. Climate change \\nwill probably be least pronounced in this region, because it is attenuated by oceanic \\neffects. Due to the presently very moderate climate, most sectors exhibit a wide range \\nof tolerance. Again, the sectors agriculture and tourism, and with some limitations also forestry, may potentially profit from climate change. \\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 189}), Document(page_content='- 191 -  \\n Tab. 7-1: Summary of vulnerability to global change (particularly climate change) \\nin Germany without further adaptation (business-as-usual scenario).

In \\nwetlands, especially the sectors water and nature conservation are highly vulnerable. In congested urban areas, especially the sectors health (heat stress) and transport will \\nbe affected. \\nThe vulnerabilities in most regions could probably be lessened to a low level, if all \\navailable potential adaptation measures were implemented in the specific regions and \\nenvironmental zones (improved-business scenario). However, in most regions adaptation measures to climate change are neither planned nor implemented. In the \\nAlpine region, vulnerability can probably only be reduced to a medium level, since the \\nadaptive capacity to the potential impacts of climate change on winter tourism, biodiversity and flood risk is limited. \\nVulnerable Sectors in Germany \\nLooking at the vulnerability of different climate-sensitive sectors, especially the sectors water, health and winter tourism appear highly vulnerable.  \\nIn all parts of Germany current vulnerability is high in the water sector, due to \\nincreasing flood risk and high potential for damage. Further regional differentiation of \\nthe expected impacts is currently not possibl e due to the uncertainties related to the \\nmodelling of regional precipitation patterns.  In addition, the risk of droughts is \\nincreasing, particularly in Eastern Germ any. Currently, few adequate adaptation \\nmeasures to this stress are locally available. This results in locally high current vulnerability. However, for the entire country there appears to be only moderate \\ncurrent vulnerability to droughts in Germany. \\nThe agricultural sector  is primarily impacted by aridity in summer. Climate change also \\nimpacts indirectly through increased risk of diseases and pest outbreaks. However, the \\nagricultural sector can adapt to changed climate and weather condition on a short-term basis due to its large choice of crop types and varieties, as well as short rotation \\ntimes. Therefore, the agricultural sector s eems to be only moderately vulnerable to \\nclimate change without further adaptation specifically to climate change . Vulnerability \\nis rated to be high merely in the drought-prone areas of Eastern Germany with poor soils. \\nSimilarly, the forestry sector  is impacted by aridity and increased risk of diseases and \\npests. In addition, there is increased risk of forest fires and extreme events. The \\nforestry sector has limited adaptive capacity due to long rotation times and high costs. \\nDrought-prone areas (Eastern Germany), as well as regions with a high proportion of out-of-natural-habitat spruce stands (lower regions in Western and South-Western \\nGermany) are rated as highly vulnerable. In general, the forestry sector is classified as \\nmoderately vulnerable to climate change.  \\nTo rate vulnerability in the sector  nature conservation  is especially difficult. Definite \\nimpacts of climate change are expected (shifts in species’ distribution, changes in \\nspecies communities etc.), however, there is no consensus on the relevance of these impacts. The current vulnerability is rated as moderate to high, depending on the \\nconservation goal. Adaptation measures (e.g. improved connections within the \\nconservation network) can only support natural processes (e.g. migration), but clearly cannot conserve the current community of species. \\nWithout further adaptation, the health sector  is rated as regionally highly vulnerable to \\nimpacts of heat waves, generally in Germany as moderately vulnerable. High \\nuncertainty exists with regard to climate change impacts on vector-borne diseases. \\nNevertheless, due to the high potential risk and the current lack of adaptation the vulnerability to vector-borne diseases seems to be high. \\nIn the tourism sector , winter sports particularly are classified as highly vulnerable. \\nDecreasing snow safety must be expe cted, for which no adequate long-term \\nadaptation measures are available. Other forms of tourism are moderately vulnerable. \\nLeisure-oriented summer tourism will probably profit from climate change.

This impacts both the flow of traffic and the infrastructure. In winter, the transport sector is likely to profit from climate change (less frost days). In general, the \\nvulnerability of the transport sector is rated as moderate. Navigation is likely to be the \\narea of highest impact, due to strongly fluctuating water levels of rivers. As with tourism, to date, there has been little debate on vulnerability to climate change in the \\nGerman transport sector. \\nThe vulnerabilities in most sectors could probably be lessened to a low level, if all in \\nthe specific sectors available potential adaptation measures were implemented \\n(improved-business scenario). In the nature conservation sector alone, vulnerability \\ncan probably be reduced only to a moderate degree due to limited adaptation options.  \\nHowever, in most sectors – as well as in most German regions – adaptation measures \\nto climate change are neither planned nor implemented. Consequently there is an urgent need for action. \\nRecommendations for Adaptation Strategies \\nIn addition to specific adaptation needs in different sectors and regions we identify several general challenges for adaptation in Germany. To reduce our vulnerability to climate change both measures to adapt to impacts of climate change, as well as \\nmeasures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are decisively responsible for \\nclimate change, have to be implemented. Adaptation measures to reduce negative impacts and to take advantage of positive impacts are necessary, because climate \\nchange is already taking place, and will continue to happen. Due to the inertia of the \\nclimate system, climate change would continue for several centuries even after a highly unlikely immediate reduction of greenhouse gases. Emission reductions are \\nnevertheless indispensable for a long-term reduction of vulnerability. Further warming \\nof our global climate beyond the adaptive capacity of Germany and the world can only \\nbe counteracted by emission reductions. Adaptation measures and emission reduction are therefore not alternative strategies, but have to be carried out in parallel. \\nIn Germany, outside the scientific communi ty climate change is discussed so far \\nalmost exclusively in the context of the n eed for emission reductions. Adaptation to \\nthe impacts of climate change has only recently received more attention, but is still \\nhighly under-represented in public awareness and in the consciousness of decision-makers in economy, policy and administration. The first step to a Germany that is \\nadapted to climate change therefore must be to create awareness of the risks and \\nopportunities. To do so, the existing pub lic awareness of the existence of climate \\nchange should be used, as well as extreme weather events (extreme rainfall events, heat waves etc.) that provide “windows of attention” for the climate problem. The \\nexisting link between risks and opportuniti es of climate change and the dominating \\npolitical themes in Germany (unemployment, economic growth etc) should be stressed, in order to secure public attention to the debate beyond the context of \\nweather extremes. When communicating the potential impacts of climate change, the \\ninherent uncertainties of the scenarios need to be made transparent; failure to do so will result in dented credibility, when exact predictions are not met. The risks of \\nclimate change can trigger mechanisms of repression or even fatalistic reactions (“I \\ncannot do anything anyway.”). To prevent such reactions from the start, “catastrophism” – i.e. stressing potential climate impacts of catastrophic extent – should be avoided. The communication of risks should always be linked to the \\ncommunication of possible adaptation measures. Role models are particularly suited to \\ncommunicate adaptation measures by providing a living example. \\nCreating awareness of potential impacts can only be a first step to a Germany that is \\nadapted to climate change. As when communicating risks and opportunities, the uncertainty in the assessment of potential impacts of climate change is a special \\nchallenge when concrete decisions about adaptation measures have to be made, e.g. ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 192}), Document(page_content='- 194 -  \\n the raising of dykes to face increasing fl ood risk. With regard to the precautionary \\nprinciple, it is an irresponsible strategy to wait for less uncertain assessments before implementing adaptation measures, since climate change and its impacts are already taking place. Furthermore, waiting for less uncertain scenarios is a treacherous hope; \\nthe results will remain uncertain in future even with increased refinement of scientific \\nmethods. Decision-makers often lack aw areness of systematic and conscious \\nstrategies to make decisions in the face of  uncertainty. Therefore support is needed. In \\nthis respect the 8-stage decision support system for decision-making about adaptation \\nto climate change, which is introduced in this report, is a first stimulus. \\nOften adaptation to the impacts of climate change will only be possible if \\nresponsibilities are shared between different actors. Ultimately, climate change adaptation – just like the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions – is a task for society a s  a  w h o l e ,  t o  w h i c h  e v e r y  s i n g l e  c i t i z e n ,  a s  w e l l  a s  a c t o r s  f r o m  t h e  e c o n o m y ,  t h e  \\npolitical sphere, administration, the media, nature conservation organisations, \\neducation and research can and should contribute. Science and education are of special importance in this, due to the complexity of the climate problem. The media \\nwill be of significant relevance in communicating potential climate impacts and \\nnecessary adaptation measures to the public. Nature conservation organisations also play a major role in this communication. Politicians and administrators must create the \\nnecessary financial, legal and organisational conditions. Administrative bodies have the \\nadditional function of informing and coordinating adaptation measures in private industry and households; this is an especially significant function in view of the current budgetary position in many communities, federal states and in the federal \\ngovernment. In addition to the climate-sensitive sectors that were analysed in this \\nstudy (forestry, agriculture, water, to urism, nature-conservation, health and \\ntransport), further adaptation measures are necessary in other sectors (e.g., the \\nconstruction sector). Finance (banks and insurances) is of central importance; it \\npossesses decisive instruments for the regulation of adaptation through the granting of loans and insurance. Finally, every German ci tizen needs to adapt, e.g. through taking \\nincreased precaution against tick bites or through building structures that are adapted \\nto higher flood risk. \\nDialogue and coordination between different actors in the process of adaptation should \\nbe facilitated, since climate adaptation is a task for society as a whole. Networking is \\nan efficient instrument for this. These networks should be organised not only within Germany, but also seek contacts outside the country: some countries have far more \\nexperience with climate change adaptation  than Germany. A network of adaptation \\nactors has already started to form through the efforts of the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) to initiate and build a “Centre of Competence for Climate Impacts”, in \\ncooperation with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Furthermore, such \\ninitiatives already exist in several federal states. Further organisational and financial support of such networks of actors through public and increasingly also through private sources is desirable, since such networks provide necessary information for \\nvulnerability assessment, as well as communication platforms for coordinated \\nadaptation measures.

In dieser Studie geht es um die Vulnerabilität gegenüber dem Globalen Wandel, unter dem hier vor allem der Klimawandel verstanden wird. Die Einwirkungen \\ndurch den Globalen Wandel auf den Menschen geschehen direkt (wie z.B. durch \\nFlutkatastrophen und Hitzewellen) und indirekt durch Auswirkungen des Globalen Wandels auf klimasensitive Bereiche bzw. Sektoren (z.B. Wasser- od. Landwirtschaft). \\nDie Vulnerabilität gegenüber dem aktuellen und zukünftigen Globalen Wandel ist stark \\nvon der Ausgangssituation abhängig. Oft steht eine Region bzw. ein Bereich schon heute unter Druck. So können aktuelle klimatische oder naturräumliche \\nRahmenbedingungen Beschränkungen mit sich  bringen (z.B. geringe Niederschläge \\noder arme Böden für die Bereiche Land- und  Forstwirtschaft). Viele Bereiche werden \\nvon Veränderungen in den sozioökonomisch en Rahmenbedingungen beeinflusst (z.B. \\nLand- und Forstwirtschaft, Gesundheit, Tourismus, Verkehr). Solche \\nRahmenbedingungen bestimmen zum großen Teil die Prädisposition einer Region bzw. eines Bereichs gegenüber Auswirkungen de s Globalen Wandels und sind in hohem \\nMaße mitverantwortlich für die regionale Differenzierung von Vulnerabilität.  \\nWie vulnerabel ein Mensch-Umwelt-System, eine Region bzw. ein Bereich gegenüber \\ndem Globalen Wandel bewertet wird, hängt neben der Prädisposition im Wesentlichen \\nvon drei Faktoren ab:  \\n• Wie ausgeprägt sind der Klimawandel und andere Elemente des Globalen Wandels \\nin der betrachteten Region? \\n• Wie stark wirkt sich der Globale Wandel in der Region potenziell auf die einzelnen \\nBereiche aus (auch als potenzielle Auswirkungen des Globalen Wandels \\nbezeichnet)? \\n• Wie hoch ist der Anpassungsgrad in den einzelnen Bereichen innerhalb der Region \\nan die potenziellen Auswirkungen? \\nDabei bestimmt sich der Anpassungsgrad aus dem Vorhandensein von ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 194}), Document(page_content='- 196 -  \\n Anpassungsmaßnahmen, die Schäden mindern oder günstige Gelegenheiten nutzen. \\nWird der momentane Anpassungsgrad in die Zukunft verlängert, ergibt sich eine \\nVulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen (Ohne-Maßnahmen-Szenario). Diese \\nVulnerabilität wird auch als aktuelle Vulnerabilität  bezeichnet. Bei der Bestimmung \\ndieser Vulnerabilität wird also angenommen, dass über die bereits bestehenden Maßnahmen (z.B. im Hochwasserschutz) in Zukunft keine weiteren Maßnahmen \\numgesetzt werden. So wird ein Eindruck  davon vermittelt, welche Schäden zu \\nerwarten sind, wenn keine weitere Anpassung an den Globalen Wandel (v.a. an den Klimawandel) erfolgt. Die aktuelle Vulnerabilität wird auf einer dreistufigen qualitativen \\nSkala (geringe – mäßige – hohe Vulnerabilität) abgeschätzt. Ein quantitativer \\nVulnerabilitätsindex wird bewusst vermieden; denn dieser würde eine Genauigkeit vortäuschen, die es weder hinsichtlich der potenziellen Auswirkungen des Globalen Wandels noch hinsichtlich der Anpassung an diese Auswirkungen gibt.  \\nWird angenommen, dass die vorhandene An passungskapazität maximal genutzt wird, \\num den zukünftigen Anpassungsgrad zu verbe ssern, ergibt sich eine Vulnerabilität mit \\nweiteren Maßnahmen (Mit-Maßnahmen-Szenario). Auch diese Vulnerabilität wird auf \\neiner dreistufigen qualitativen Skala (g eringe – mäßige – hohe Vulnerabilität) \\nabgeschätzt. Durch den Vergleich der Vulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen (Ohne-\\nMaßnahmen-Szenario) und der Vulnerabilität mit weiteren Maßnahmen (Mit-\\nMaßnahmen-Szenario) entsteht ein Eindruck der Schäden aufgrund des Globalen Wandels (v.a. des Klimawandels) mit und ohne weitere Anpassungsmaßnahmen.  \\nEine Vulnerabilität eines Mensch-Umwelt-Systems ist demnach nur dann gegeben, \\nwenn dieses System nicht an die potenziellen Auswirkungen des Globalen Wandels angepasst ist. Dieser Anpassungsgrad wird seinerseits durch die Anpassungskapazität \\ndes Mensch-Umwelt-Systems bestimmt. Die Anpassungskapazität ist gering, wenn die \\nnotwendigen Ressourcen (finanziell, organisatorisch, legislativ, wissensbezogen etc.) zur Realisierung eines ausreichenden Anpassungsgrads nicht zur Verfügung stehen. In \\ndiesem Fall wird sich das Mensch-Umwelt-System nicht an die Auswirkungen des \\nGlobalen Wandels anpassen können.  \\nMethodische Umsetzung  \\nZur Erreichung der genannten Ziele standen Ergebnisse des vom PIK koordinierten \\neuropäischen Verbundprojektes ATEAM30 zur Verfügung. Diese Ergebnisse basieren auf \\neinem Satz konsistenter, räumlich expliziter Szenarien des Globalen Wandels, einer Reihe von Ökosystemmodellen, Indikatoren für Ökosystemfunktionen sowie einem \\nkontinuierlichen Dialog mit Stakeholdern. Ein Großteil der naturwissenschaftlichen \\nInformationen zum Globalen Wandel und seinen potenziellen Auswirkungen in diesem Bericht beruht auf Auswertungen von Ergebnissen dieses Projektes (für eine genauere \\nBeschreibung der naturwissenschaftlichen Me thoden siehe Kap. 2.1-2.4).

Ja hrhundert sind einzigartig – z.B. sind die \\nderzeitigen Temperaturen auf der Nordhalbkugel wahrscheinlich die wärmsten seit \\nmindestens 2000 Jahren. In der Nordhemisphäre waren die 1990’er Jahre die wärmste Dekade und die Jahre 1998, 2002 und 2003 die drei wärmsten Jahre in den letzten tausend Jahren. Seit 1990 stieg die globale Mitteltemperatur um 0,7 ± 0,2 °C an. Der \\nNiederschlag über den mittleren und höhere n Breiten der Nordhemisphäre nahm im \\n20. Jahrhundert um 0,5 bis 1% pro Dekade zu, während er über den subtropischen \\nBreiten abnahm. Zudem wurde ein vers tärktes Auftreten von Klimaextremen \\nbeobachtet, wie z.B. eine ungewöhnliche Häufung von Temperaturanomalien im \\npazifischen Ozean (sog. „El Niño - Ereignisse“) seit 1970. Seit 1950 ist ein deutlicher \\nAnstieg der Schäden durch Naturkatastrophen und Überschwemmungen zu verzeichnen.  \\nNatürliche Faktoren wie Vulkanausbrüche, Veränderungen in der Sonnenaktivität oder \\nSchwankungen der Umlaufparameter der Erde um die Sonne tragen nur einen kleinen Teil zur Erklärung dieses Klimawandels bei. In der Wissenschaft herrscht mittlerweile \\ngroße Einigkeit, dass der größte Teil des K limawandels auf menschliche Aktivitäten, \\ninsbesondere die Emission von Treibhausgasen zurückzuführen ist. Um unseren Energiebedarf zu decken, verbrauchen wir in wenigen Generationen fossile \\nBrennstoffe, die in Hunderten von Millionen Jahren entstanden sind. Dabei entstehen \\nTreibhausgase wie zum Beispiel Kohlen dioxid. Treibhausgase wie Wasserdampf, \\nKohlendioxid (CO\\n2), Methan (CH 4) und Lachgas (N 2O) strahlen die von der Erde \\nausgestrahlte Wärmestrahlung zum Te il zurück und tragen durch diesen \\n„Treibhauseffekt“ zu einer Erwärmung der Atmosphäre und der Erdoberfläche bei.  \\nSeit Beginn der Industrialisierung hat sich durch die Verbrennung fossiler Energie-\\nträger und Landnutzungsänderungen die atmosphärische Konzentration von CO 2, dem \\nwichtigsten Treibhausgas, um 34% von 280 auf 375 ppm erhöht und damit wahrscheinlich das höchste Niveau der letzten 400’000 Jahre erreicht. Die \\nKonzentration von Methan, dem zweitwichtigst en Treibhausgas, erhöhte sich in dieser \\nZeit sogar um mehr als 150%. Bereits für die nächsten Jahrzehnte wird mit einer Verdopplung der atmosphärischen Kohlendioxidkonzentration gerechnet (auf bis zu nahezu 600 ppm, verglichen mit dem vorindustriellen Niveau), wenn nicht drastische \\nEmissionsminderungen dem entgegenwirken (siehe auch Kap. 1.2). \\nGlobaler Klimawandel – Klimap rojektionen in die Zukunft \\nDas erklärte Ziel der Europäischen Union ist, die globale Klimaerwärmung unter 2ºC \\nrelativ zu vorindustriellen Werten zu halten, um „gefährlichen Klimawandel“ zu \\nverhindern (siehe Artike l 2 der UNFCCC). Die Klimasensitivität, d.h. der \\nTemperaturanstieg bei verdoppelter CO 2-Konzentration, wird global zwischen 1,5 und \\n4,5ºC angenommen. Die Wahrscheinlichkei t, das 2-Grad-Ziel langfristig zu \\nüberschreiten, steigt mit CO 2-Konzentrationen, die viel höher als heutige Werte liegen, \\nrapide an. Um das 2-Grad-Ziel zu erreichen, müssten die heutigen globalen Emissionen von ca. 7 Gt Kohlenstoff pro Jahr  auf 2 Gt pro Jahr gesenkt werden. Das ist \\neine beachtliche Herausforderung angesichts der Emissionen der USA und \\nbevölkerungsreicher Länder wie China und Indien, die zudem ein großes Wirtschaftswachstum aufweisen. Die Vorher sage von Emissionsverläufen ist äußerst \\nunsicher. In dieser Studie benutzen wir die vom IPCC herausgegebenen SRES-\\nSzenarien. Sie beinhalten keine aktive Klimapolitik, umspannen aber dennoch eine Bandbreite auch angesichts heutiger klimapolitischer Strategien möglicher Szenarien.  \\nFür die Zukunft geht der IPCC von einem weiteren Anstieg der Konzentration aller \\nTreibhausgase auf Werte zwischen 650 bis 1215 ppm CO\\n2-Equivalente aus. Allein die \\nCO2-Konzentration steigt demnach auf Werte zwischen 607 und 958 ppm, was einer \\nVerdopplung bis Verdreifachung der Werte de r vorindustriellen Zeit gleichkommt. In \\nder Folge wird mit einem weiter beschleunigten Anstieg der globalen Mitteltemperatur um 1,4-5,8°C bis zum Jahr 2100 gerechnet. Im globalen Mittel wird eine leichte ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 196}), Document(page_content='- 198 -  \\n Zunahme der Niederschläge erwartet, die sich aber zeitlich und räumlich sehr \\nheterogen verteilt.  \\nDie exakte Vorhersage von Klimaextreme reignissen ist derzeit unmöglich. Aber \\nextreme Wetter- und Klimaereignisse wie heiße Tage, sommerliche Dürre und \\nStarkniederschläge werden wahrscheinlich oder sehr wahrscheinlich im 21. Jahr-hundert zunehmen. Auch eine Zunahme der Zyklonenaktivität in den Tropen ist \\nwahrscheinlich. Kälteextreme werden sehr wahrscheinlich abnehmen (siehe auch Kap. \\n1.2).  \\nGlobaler Wandel in Deutschland – Historische Trends im Klima \\nLangjährige Reihen der Wetteraufzeichnung  zeigen, dass Deutschland bereits vom \\nKlimawandel betroffen ist. Hinsichtlich der Temperaturentwicklung  zeigt sich, dass in \\nDeutschland wie im weltweiten Durchschnitt die 1990er Jahre das wärmste Jahrzehnt im 20. Jahrhundert waren. Die Jahresmitteltemperatur hat von 1900-2000 um ca. 0,8 \\n- 1°C zugenommen. Allerdings verlief di e Erwärmung nicht linear. Einer starken \\nErwärmung bis 1911 folgte eine wechselhafte Periode. Die 1940er Jahre waren außergewöhnlich warm. Nach einer erneuten Abkühlung ist seit Ende der 1970er Jahre \\nein kontinuierlicher und rapider Anstieg zu beobachten, der bis heute anhält. Regional \\nvariiert das Bild sehr stark. In der letzten Dekade (1990’er Jahre) war der Anstieg in Süd- und Südwestdeutschland überdurchschnittlich. Aussagen zu der saisonalen Ausprägung des Temperaturanstiegs schwank en je nach Zeitraum und Methode. In \\nden letzten 20 Jahren ist ein Trend zu einer stärkeren Erwärmung im Winter als im \\nSommer zu beobachten. So betrug in Deut schland die Erwärmung in der Periode von \\n1981 – 2000 in den Wintermonaten 2,3°C, in den Sommermonaten nur 0,7°C. \\nDie Niederschläge  in Deutschland sind räumlich und saisonal von starken \\nSchwankungen geprägt. Langfristig lassen sich weder in den Mittelwerten noch in der \\nsaisonalen oder regionalen Verteilung signifikante Trends ermitteln. In den letzten 100 \\nJahren findet sich zwar ein leichter Trend zu mehr Niederschlag im Winter, aber auch dieser ist nicht signifikant. In den letzten 30 Jahren ist allerdings eine deutliche Zunahme der Winterniederschläge zu verzeichnen. Die Sommerniederschläge änderten \\nsich hingegen nur wenig. \\nVon Bedeutung sind auch Veränderungen in der Schneedeckendauer . Für Bayern und \\nBaden-Württemberg wurden in Lagen unter 300m Abnahmen von 30-40% seit 1950 \\nbeobachtet. In mittleren Lagen (300-800m) beträgt die Abnahme 10-20%. In höheren Lagen über 800m sind aufgrund vermehrter Niederschläge im Winter und für \\nSchneefall ausreichend niedriger Temperaturen nur geringe Abnahmen, teilweise sogar \\nZunahmen zu verzeichnen.  \\nEine Zunahme von Klimaextremen , wie Hitzewellen, Starkniederschlägen oder \\nStürmen lässt sich nur teilweise belegen. Für Hitzeextreme  wie Hitzetage (T>30°C) \\noder Hitzewellen (Zeitintervalle von mehr als 3 Tagen, in denen die Tagesmaxima über einer, bezogen auf das stationsabhängige Temperaturniveau hohen oberen Schwelle \\nliegen) ist ein deutlicher Trend zu beobachten. So hat sich z.B. die Wahrscheinlichkeit \\ndes Eintretens von Hitzetagen in den Monate n Juli und August an fast allen Stationen \\nin Deutschland in den letzen hundert und besonders deutlich in den letzten zwanzig \\nJahren erhöht. Starkniederschläge haben insbesondere in den letzten 40 Jahren des \\n20. Jahrhunderts an Häufigkeit und Intensität zugenommen. Insgesamt ist dieser Trend für das Winterhalbjahr deutlicher als für das Sommerhalbjahr. Auch zur \\nHäufigkeit und Intensität von Sturmböen liegen Untersuchungen vor. Hier lässt sich bis \\nheute allerdings kein statistisch gesicherter Trend herauslesen. Tendenziell hat die Wahrscheinlichkeit extrem hoher täglicher Maxima (Bft > 8) im Winter überwiegend zugenommen (Ausnahme Küstenbereich) und  im Sommer überwiegend abgenommen \\n(Ausnahme Süddeutschland) (siehe auch Kap. 3.1.1).

Räumlich zeigen viele Szenarien eine besonders starke Erwärmung im Südwesten, z.T. auch im äußersten Osten Deutschlands. Saisonal ergibt sich in den verschiedenen \\nSzenarien ein uneinheitliches Bild. Der Trend zur stärkeren Erwärmung im Winter, der \\nin der Vergangenheit beobachtet wurde,  wird in den Zukunftsszenarien nicht \\nwiedergegeben. \\nFür den Jahres niederschlag  zeigen alle Klimaszenarien nur sehr geringe \\nVeränderungen, die bis 2080 im Wesentlichen unter 10% liegen. Stärkere \\nVeränderungen zeigen sich bei Sommer- und Winterniederschlägen. Während in allen \\nsieben Szenarien eine Erhöhung der Winterniederschläge zu beobachten ist, nehmen die Sommerniederschläge in den meisten Szenarien ab. Dies ist konsistent mit dem bereits zu beobachtenden Trend einer Verschiebung der Niederschläge in den Winter. \\nRegional ergibt sich für die Winterniederschläge eine besonders deutliche Zunahme in \\nSüddeutschland, zumindest in den auf dem Klimamodell HadCM3 aufbauenden Szenarien. Der Rückgang der Sommerniederschläge konzentriert sich in diesen \\nSzenarien auf Südwestdeutschland (Rheinland) und die zentralen Teile \\nOstdeutschlands. Die Ergebnisse der anderen Modelle liefern allerdings räumlich z.T. widersprüchliche Trends (siehe auch Kap. 3.1.2).  \\nVulnerable Regionen in Deutschland \\nFasst man die Ergebnisse zur Vulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen (Ohne-Maßnahmen-Szenario) der einzelnen Bereiche zusammen und gliedert sie nach Regionen (Naturräume), zeigt sich, dass Südwestdeutschland (Oberrheingraben), die \\nzentralen Teile Ostdeutschlands (Nordostdeutsches Tiefland, Südostdeutsche Becken \\nund Hügel) und die Alpen aktuell die höchste Vulnerabilität gegenüber dem Klimawandel in den ausgewählten klimasensi tiven Bereichen aufweisen (Tab. 7-). Die \\ngeringste Vulnerabilität zeigen die deutschen Mittelgebirge und Nordwestdeutschland \\n(siehe auch Kap. 6.1.1 und Kap. 4).  \\nIn Ostdeutschland (Nordostdeutsches Tiefland und Südostdeutsche Hügel und Becken)  \\nist die geringe Wasserverfügbarkeit und die Gefahr von Dürren im Sommer ausschlaggebend für die „hohe“ aktuelle Vuln erabilität in vielen Bereichen. Die schon \\naktuell ungünstige klimatische Wasserbilanz wird durch die bereits zu beobachtende \\nund weiter zu erwartende Abnahme der Sommerniederschläge und durch eine erhöhte \\nVerdunstung als Folge steigender Temperatur en weiter verschlechtert. Davon betroffen \\nsind insbesondere die Land- und Forstwir tschaft, aber auch der Verkehrsbereich \\n(Schifffahrt). Hinzu kommt eine „hohe“ Vulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen \\ngegenüber Hochwasser in den Einzugsgebiete n der großen Flüsse Elbe und Oder. In \\nder Lausitz, wo mit besonders hohen Somme rtemperaturen zu rechnen ist, muss von \\neiner „hohen“ aktuellen Vulnerabilität im Bereich Gesundheit aufgrund hoher \\nHitzbelastung ausgegangen werden.  \\nIn Südwestdeutschland  (Oberrheingraben) stellen vor allem die hohen Temperaturen \\nein Problem dar. Hier, wo schon aktuell die höchsten Temperaturen in Deutschland \\ngemessen werden, wird in Zukunft mi t der stärksten Erwärmung innerhalb \\nDeutschlands gerechnet. Das bringt „hohe“ Vulnerabilitäten ohne weitere Maßnahmen \\nim Bereich Gesundheit mit sich. Auch Land- und Forstwirtschaft sind aktuell „hoch“ \\nvulnerabel gegenüber einer schnellen Erwärm ung. Hinzu kommt eine steigende Gefahr \\nvon Hochwasser im frühen Frühjahr, ausgelöst durch eine Verschiebung der \\nNiederschläge vom Sommer in den Winter sowie eine Zunahme von \\nStarkregenereignissen.  \\nIn den Alpen  stellt neben der Ausprägung des Klimawandels, welche in dieser Region \\nleicht überdurchschnittlich ist, die Sensitivität vieler Bereiche die Hauptursache für die ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 198}), Document(page_content='- 200 -  \\n „hohe“ Vulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen dar. Vor allem im Bereich Biodiversität \\nsind die Alpen sehr anfällig, da sie durch eine hohe Anzahl endemischer Tier- und Pflanzenarten geprägt sind, denen sich im Zuge des Klimawandels kaum Ausweichmöglichkeiten bieten. Auch die Vielzahl an kleinklimatischen \\nSonderstandorten und azonalen Biotopen erhöht die Vulnerabilität. In den Alpen ist \\naufgrund der geringen Retentionsflächen die Hochwassergefahr besonders hoch. Hinzu \\nkommt die Anfälligkeit und die geringe Anpassungsfähigkeit des Bereichs Wintersport \\ngegen einen Rückgang der Schneesicherheit.  \\nDie deutschen Mittelgebirge  erweisen sich im Vergleich aktuell nur als „mäßig“ \\nvulnerabel. Hier ist das Klima aktuell eher kühl und feucht, so dass eine Veränderung \\nzu einem wärmeren Klima für manche Bereiche (z.B. Landwirtschaft) sogar eher eine Chance darstellen kann. „Hoch“ ist die aktuelle Vulnerabilität im Bereich Hochwasser, speziell gegenüber lokalen Hochwasserereignissen, die von konvektiven \\nStarkniederschlägen ausgelöst werden.

Zwar besteht hier eine „hohe“  aktuelle Vulnerabilität aufgrund evtl. \\nintensiverer Sturmfluten. Zudem sind die unmittelbaren Küstenbereiche durch den \\nsteigenden Meeresspiegel bedroht. Allerd ings sind hier die Anpassungsmaßnahmen \\nbereits relativ weit vorangeschritten. In anderen Bereichen können die Küstengebiete \\neher vom Klimawandel profitieren. Das betrifft sowohl die Bereiche Land- und \\nForstwirtschaft als auch den Tourismus, der von steigenden Sommertemperaturen und abnehmenden Sommerniederschlägen profitiert.  \\nDie geringste aktuelle Vulnerabilität wird für Nordwestdeutschland  gesehen. Hier \\ndämpfen die ozeanischen Einflüsse die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels ab, so dass hier vermutlich mit den geringsten Klimaver änderungen zu rechnen ist. Aufgrund des \\naktuell sehr gemäßigten Klimas weisen die meisten Bereiche hier einen relativ hohen \\nToleranzbereich auf. Auch hier werden die Bereiche Landwirtschaft und Tourismus, mit Einschränkungen auch die Forstwirtschaft, potenziell eher vom Klimawandel \\nprofitieren. \\nNeben diesen in Tab. 7- dargestellten Regionen bzw. Naturräumen zeigen außerdem \\nFeuchtgebiete und Ballungsräume  eine „hohe“ Vulnerabilität ohne weitere Maßnahmen. \\nIn Feuchtgebieten sind vor allem die Bereiche Wasser und Biodiversität hoch vulnerabel. In Ballungsräumen sind die Be reiche Gesundheit (Hitzebelastung) und \\nVerkehr besonders betroffen.  \\nUnter der Annahme, dass in den verschie denen Regionen bzw. Naturräumen jeweils \\nalle potenziell zur Verfügung stehenden Anpassungsmaßnahmen genutzt werden, \\nließen sich wahrscheinlich die Vulnerabilitäten in fast allen Regionen auf ein „geringes“ \\nAusmaß vermindern (Mit-Maßnahmen-Szenario). Allerdings sind in den meisten Regionen Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Klimawandel weder in Planung noch \\numgesetzt. Ausschließlich im Alpenraum lässt sich die Vulnerabilität wahrscheinlich nur \\nauf ein „mittleres“ Maß reduzieren, denn für die potenziellen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf den Wintersport, auf die Biodiversität und die Hochwassergefahr \\nbestehen nur begrenzte Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. \\nVulnerable Bereiche in Deutschland \\nWird die Vulnerabilität hinsichtlich der untersuchten sieben klimasensitiven Bereiche \\nbetrachtet, erweisen sich vor allem die Bereiche Wasser, Gesundheit und \\nWintersporttourismus als hoch vulnerabel (siehe auch Kap. 6.1.2 u. Kap. 4). \\nIm Bereich Wasser  ist allen Teilen Deutschlands mit einer „hohen“ aktuellen \\nVulnerabilität aufgrund steigender Hochwa ssergefahr und hohem Schadenspotenzial zu \\nrechnen. Die hohe Unsicherheit bei der Modellierung der regionalen Niederschlagsverteilung lässt eine weitere regionale Differenzierung im Moment noch nicht zu. Des weiteren besteht insbesondere in Ostdeutschland eine Gefahr von \\nDürren. Hier stehen bisher kaum geeignete Anpassungsmaßnahmen zur Verfügung. \\nDas führt lokal zu einer „hohen“ aktuellen Vulnerabilität. Deutschlandweit ist die aktuelle Vulnerabilität gegenüber Dürren jedoch nur „mäßig“.  \\nDie Landwirtschaft  ist vor allem von Trockenheit im Sommer betroffen. Indirekt steigt \\ndurch den Klimawandel auch die Gefahr von Schädlingsbefall und Krankheiten. Jedoch \\nkann sich die Landwirtschaft aufgrund der umfangreichen Auswahl an Fruchtarten und \\nSorten und der kurzen Umtriebszeiten relativ kurzfristig an veränderte Klima- und Wetterbedingungen anpassen. Folglich is t die Vulnerabilität der Landwirtschaft \\ngegenüber dem Klimawandel ohne weitere Anpassungsmaßnahmen, die sich spezifisch \\nauf den Klima wandel  beziehen, insgesamt als „mäßig“ zu bezeichnen. Nur in den von \\nDürren bedrohten Regionen Ostdeutschlands mit ihren oft armen Böden wird die aktuelle Vulnerabilität als „hoch“ eingestuft.  \\nAuch die Forstwirtschaft  ist von Trockenheit und der zunehmenden Gefahr von \\nKrankheiten und Schädlingsbefall betroffen. Hinzu kommt eine erhöhte \\nWaldbrandgefahr sowie die Gefahr durch Extremereignisse. Die ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 201}), Document(page_content='- 203 -  \\n Anpassungsmöglichkeiten sind in der Fo rstwirtschaft aufgrund der langen \\nUmtriebszeiten und hoher Kosten beschränkt. Als aktuell „hoch“ vulnerabel werden hier von Dürre betroffene Regionen (Ostdeutschland) und Regionen mit sehr hoher Erwärmung und einem hohen Anteil nicht standortangepasster Fichtenbestände \\n(niedere Regionen in West- und Südwestdeutschland) eingestuft. Insgesamt kann aber \\ndie Forstwirtschaft als „mäßig“ vulnerab el gegenüber dem Klimawandel angesehen \\nwerden.  \\nBesonders schwer fällt die Einschätzung der Vulnerabilität für den Bereich Biodiversität \\nund Naturschutz . Hier wird zwar mit deutlichen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels \\ngerechnet (Verschiebung der Artenareale,  Veränderung von Lebensgemeinschaften \\netc.), allerdings herrscht noch keine Einigkeit über die Bedeutung dieser Auswirkungen. Die aktuelle Vulnerabilität wird als „mäßig“ bis „hoch“ bewertet, je nachdem, welches Schutzziel man betrachtet. Klar ist, dass Anpassungsmaßnahmen \\n(z.B. Verbesserung der Vernetzung) nur die natürlichen Prozesse (z.B. die Migration) \\nunterstützen können, nicht aber den heutigen Stand der Artenzusammensetzung konservieren können.  \\nIm Bereich Gesundheit  besteht ohne weitere Maßnahmen hinsichtlich der \\nAuswirkungen von Hitzewellen regional eine „hohe“, deutschlandweit eine „mäßige“ \\nVulnerabilität. Im Bereich vektorübertragener Krankheiten herrscht noch große \\nUnsicherheit über die Klimawirkung. Aufgrund des potenziell hohen Risikos und des aktuellen Anpassungsdefizits ist dennoch von einer „hohen“ Vulnerabilität gegenüber vektorübertragenen Krankheiten auszugehen.  \\nIm Bereich Tourismus  ist der Wintersporttourismus aktuell als „hoch“ vulnerabel \\neinzuschätzen. Hier muss mit einer zurückgehenden Schneesicherheit gerechnet \\nwerden, für die langfristig kaum geeignet e Anpassungsmaßnahmen bestehen. Für die \\nübrigen Tourismusformen besteht eine „mäßige“ Vulnerabilität. Der freizeitorientierte Sommertourismus in Deutschland wird vom Klimawandel wahrscheinlich eher \\nprofitieren. Im Tourismus hat bisher insgesamt kaum eine Auseinandersetzung mit \\ndem Thema Klimawandel stattgefunden.  \\nDer Bereich Verkehr  ist vor allem durch die potenzielle Zunahme klimatischer \\nExtremereignisse (Stürme und Starkregener eignisse) sowie von extremer Hitze im \\nSommer gefährdet. Betroffen ist sowohl der Verkehrsfluss als auch die Infrastruktur. Im Winter wird der Bereich Verkehr eher vom Klimawandel profitieren (weniger \\nFrostage). Insgesamt ist die Vulnerabilität des Verkehrsbereiches als „mäßig“ \\neinzustufen. Wahrscheinlich am stärksten betroffen ist die Schifffahrt, die durch stark schwankende Pegelstände der Flüsse beeinträchtigt sein kann. Auch im Bereich \\nVerkehr hat bisher nahezu keine Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema Klimawandel \\nstattgefunden. \\nUnter der Annahme, dass in den einzelnen Bereichen alle potenziell zur Verfügung \\nstehenden Anpassungsmaßnahmen genutzt werden, ließen sich wahrscheinlich die Vulnerabilitäten in fast allen Bereichen auf ein „geringes“ Ausmaß vermindern (Mit-Maßnahmen-Szenario). Ausschließlich im Biodiversitätsbereich lässt sich die \\nVulnerabilität aufgrund beschränkter Anpa ssungsmöglichkeiten wahrscheinlich nur auf \\nein „mittleres“ Maß reduzieren.  \\nIn den meisten Bereichen – wie auch in den meisten Regionen Deutschlands – sind \\nAnpassungsmaßnahmen an den Klimawandel bisher allerdings weder in Planung noch umgesetzt. Hier besteht demnach großer Handlungsbedarf. \\nAnpassungsempfehlungen \\nNeben den spezifischen Anpassungsnotwendig keiten in den verschiedenen Bereichen \\nund Regionen (siehe Kap. 4) ergeben sich für die Anpassung in Deutschland einige übergreifenden Herausforderungen (siehe Kap. 6.2). Um die Vulnerabilität gegenüber \\ndem Klimawandel zu reduzieren, müssen sowohl Anpassungsmaßnahmen an die \\nAuswirkungen des Klimawandels als auch Maßnahmen zur Minderung der \\nTreibhausgasemissionen, die den Klimawande l entscheidend verursachen, umgesetzt \\nwerden. Anpassungsmaßnahmen zur Minderung  der negativen Auswirkungen und zur ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 202}), Document(page_content='- 204 -  \\n Nutzung positiver Auswirkungen sind notwendig, denn der Klimawandel findet bereits \\nstatt und wird weiter stattfinden. Selbst bei einer sehr unwahrscheinlichen sofortigen Reduzierung der den Klimawandel entscheide nd bedingenden Treibhausgasemissionen \\nwürde der Klimawandel aufgrund der Träg heit des Klimasystems noch einige \\nJahrhunderte weiter voranschreiten. Anderers eits sind zur langfristigen Minderung der \\nVulnerabilität Emissionsminderungen unabdingbar; denn nur so kann einer weiteren Aufheizung des Weltklimas entgegengewirkt werden, die letztlich die \\nAnpassungsfähigkeit Deutschlands und  der Welt übersteigen würde. \\nAnpassungsmaßnahmen und Emissionsminderungen stellen also keine Alternativen dar, sondern müssen parallel durchgeführt werden.  \\nDer Klimawandel wird in Deutschland außerhalb der Wissenschaft bisher fast \\nausschließlich im Sinne der Notwendigkeit zur Reduktion von Treibhausgasemissionen diskutiert. Die Anpassung an die Folgen des Klimawandels in Deutschland erhält erst \\nseit kurzer Zeit vermehrte Aufmerksamkeit, ist jedoch im Bewusstsein der \\nÖffentlichkeit und von Entscheidungsträgern in Wirtschaft, Politik und Verwaltung noch \\nweit unterrepräsentiert (siehe auch Kap. 4 und 5). Vor diesem Hintergrund muss in \\neinem ersten Schritt auf dem Weg zu einem an den Klimawandel angepassten \\nDeutschland ein Risiko- aber auch Chance nbewusstsein geschaffen werden. Hierbei \\nkönnen und sollten das weithin bestehende Bewusstsein von der Existenz eines \\nglobalen Klimawandels ebenso genutzt werden wie extreme Wetterereignisse \\n(Starkniederschläge, Hitzewellen etc.), die „Aufmerksamkeitsfenster“ für die \\nKlimaproblematik darstellen. Um die Aufmerksamkeit auch außerhalb des Wetterextrem-Kontextes zu binden, sollte der bestehende Bezug vieler Risiken und \\nChancen des Klimawandels zu den dominierenden Themen in Deutschland \\n(Arbeitslosigkeit, Wirtschaftswachstum etc. ) betont werden. In der Kommunikation der \\npotenziellen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels sollten die bestehenden Unsicherheiten \\nin den Szenarien transparent gemacht werden; ein Verzicht darauf führt langfristig zur \\nUnglaubwürdigkeit, wenn konkrete Vorhersagen nicht eintreffen. Die Risiken des Klimawandels können zu Verdrängungsreaktionen oder sogar zu fatalistischen \\nReaktionen („Ich kann ja doch nichts tun.“) führen. Um diese Reaktionen von \\nvornherein zu verhindern, sollte ein „Katastrophismus“ – d.h. die Betonung von potenziellen Klimafolgen katastrophalen Ausmaßes – vermieden und die Kommunikation von Risiken immer mit der Kommunikation von \\nAnpassungsmöglichkeiten verbunden werden. Zur Kommunikation von \\nAnpassungsmöglichkeiten sind Vorbilder, die Anpassungsmaßnahmen „vorleben“, besonders geeignet.  \\nDie Schaffung eines Bewusstseins möglicher Auswirkungen des Klimawandels kann \\naber nur ein erster Schritt auf dem Weg zu einem an den Klimawandel angepassten \\nDeutschland sein. Wenn es um konkrete Anpassungsentscheidungen geht – \\nbeispielsweise die Erhöhung von Deichen aufgrund steigender Hochwassergefahr – wird die Unsicherheit der Folgen des Klimawandels, wie schon in der Kommunikation der Chancen und Risiken des Klimawandels, zu einer besonderen Herausforderung. Auf \\ngenauere Studien zu warten, bevor man Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Klimawandel \\nvornimmt, ist im Sinne des Vorsorgeprinzips eine unverantwortliche Strategie, denn der Klimawandel und seine Auswirkungen finden bereits statt. Zum anderen wäre das \\nWarten auf weniger unsichere Szenariene rgebnisse eine trügerische Hoffnung; denn \\nauch bei weiterer Verfeinerung der wissenschaftlichen Methoden werden die Ergebnisse in Zukunft unsicher bleiben. Oft fehlt bei Entscheidungsträgern aber Wissen \\nüber systematische und bewusste Strategien zum Entscheiden unter Unsicherheit. \\nDaher besteht hier Unterstützungsbedarf. Da s in diesem Bericht vorgestellte 8-stufige \\nEntscheidungsunterstützungssystem zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel (siehe Kap. 6.2.4) liefert hierzu erste Anregungen.  \\nOft wird die Anpassung an die Folgen des Klimawandels nur im Sinne einer \\nVerantwortungsteilung zwischen verschiede nen Akteuren zu bewerkstelligen sein. \\nLetztlich ist die Klimaanpassung – wie auch die Verminderung der \\nTreibhausgasemissionen – eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe, zu der jeder einzelne Bürger ebenso wie Akteure aus Wirtschaft, Politik, Verwaltung, Medien, \\nUmweltverbänden, Bildung und Forschung beitragen können und sollten. Wissenschaft \\nund Bildung kommen dabei aufgrund der Komplexität der Klimaproblematik eine ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 203}), Document(page_content='- 205 -  \\n entscheidende Bedeutung zu. Die Medien werden besonders für die öffentliche \\nVermittlung möglicher Klimafolgen und notwendiger Anpassungsmaßnahmen wichtig sein. Auch Umweltorganisationen spielen hier eine große Rolle. Durch Politik und Verwaltung müssen die notwendigen finanziellen, gesetzlichen und organisatorischen \\nRahmenbedingungen geschaffen werden. Der Verwaltung kommt darüber hinaus auch \\neine Informations- und Koordinationsfunktion für Anpassungsmaßnahmen in Privatwirtschaft und -haushalten zu, die vor dem Hintergrund der Haushaltslage in \\nvielen Kommunen, Ländern und im Bund beso ndere Bedeutung erhalten. Zusätzlich zu \\nden in dieser Studie untersuchten klimasensitiven Bereichen Forstwirtschaft, Landwirtschaft, Wasserwirtschaft, Tourismus,  Naturschutz / Biodiversität, Gesundheit \\nund Verkehr sind auch in weiteren Bereichen (z.B. im Bausektor) \\nAnpassungsmaßnahmen notwendig. Der Finanzwirtschaft (Banken und \\nVersicherungen) kommt eine zentrale Be deutung zu; denn über die Kredit- und \\nVersicherungsvergabe verfügt sie über entscheidende Steuerungsinstrumente für \\nVorsorgemaßnahmen. Auch die Anpassung jedes einzelnen Bürgers in Deutschland ist \\ngefragt, z.B. bei einer gesteigerten Vorsicht vor Zeckenbissen oder im hochwasserangepassten Bauen.  \\nDa die Anpassung an den Klimawandel eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe ist, sollte \\nder Dialog und die Abstimmung zwischen  den verschiedenen Anpassungsakteuren \\ngefördert werden. Die Bildung von Netzwerken  ist hier ein sehr geeignetes Mittel. \\nDabei sollten sich diese Netzwerke nicht nur innerhalb Deutschlands organisieren, sondern Kontakte auch im Ausland aufbauen; denn dort liegen zum Teil weit umfangreichere Erfahrungen mit der Anpa ssung an den Klimawandel vor als in \\nDeutschland. Der Aufbau eines solchen Akte urs-Netzwerks in Deutschland wurde im \\nRahmen der Bemühungen des Umweltb undesamtes, ein Kompetenzzentrum \\nKlimafolgen einzurichten, bei dem auch eine Kooperation mit dem Bundesministerium \\nfür Bildung und Forschung angestrebt wird, bereits begonnen (siehe auch Kap. 5). \\nAuch in einigen Bundesländern existieren bereits entsprechende Initiativen. Eine weitere organisatorische und finanzielle Unterstützung dieser Akteurs-Netzwerke durch \\nstaatliche und zunehmend auch privatwirtschaf tliche Quellen wäre wünschenswert, da \\ndiese Netzwerke notwendige Informationen für Vulnerabilitätsabschätzungen liefern, \\naber auch Kommunikationsplattformen für abgestimmte Anpassungsmaßnahmen darstellen. \\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\umweltbundesamt.pdf', 'page': 204})]\n"

       " Document(page_content=\"2 \\n1 Introduction \\nAs transportation technology evolves, more and more car manufac turers are announc-\\ning their will to introduce new kinds of vehicles into the auto mobile market.\\n\\nSuch ve-\\nhicles include Autonomous (AV) and Connected Vehicles (CV) as w ell as Electric Ve-\\nhicles.\\n\\nAccording to [14] Connected Vehicles are considered “vehicles that use any of a num-\\nber of different communication technologies to communicate with the driver, other cars \\non the road (vehicle-to-vehicle [V2V]), roadside infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastruc-\\nture [V2I]), and the “Cloud” [V2C] .” The U.S. Department of Transportation's Na-\\ntional Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defines Au tonomous or fully \\nautomated or “self-driving” vehicles as “ Automated vehicles are those in which at least \\nsome aspects of a safety-critical control function (e.g., steering, throttle, or braking) \\noccur without direct driver input” [45].\\n\\nIn 2014 the Society of Automotive Engineers \\n(SAE) classified AVs in 6 different levels of automation, from level 0 - where no sys-\\ntems interfere with driving tasks, to full automation level 5 [ 52].\\n\\nWhile the terms Connected Vehicle or Autonomous Vehicle refer t o the way a vehi-\\ncle’s course is controlled, the terms Plug-in Hybrid Electric ( PHEVs), Battery electric \\nvehicles (BEVs) or Hybrid electri c vehicles (HEVs) refer to the  way the vehicle is pow-\\nered.\\n\\nLiterature defines that Electric Vehicles or EVs are thos e that are  powered \\nsolely by electric rechargeable batteries.\\n\\nOn the other hand, P lug-in Hybrid Electric \\nvehicles are those that are powered by a combination of both el ectric batteries and  a \\npetrol or diesel engine [66].\\n\\nTherefore, both Connected and Aut onomous Vehicles can \\neither be Electric, Plug-in Hybrid Electric or conventional gas oline/petrol empowered.\\n\\nWhen it comes to transport, some of the basic motives, driving scientists to improve \\nvehicle technology, are improved vehicle and road safety and le ss vehicle emissions.\\n\\nEspecially when it comes to CAVs, much effort has been given to  define the environ-\\nmental outcome of their implementation both concerning ghg emis sions and noise.\\n\\n2 Environmental issues due to traffic \\nTraffic sector has an impact both on air and noise pollution [8 , 2, 62, 63, 48 and 61].\\n\\nIn \\norder to be able to fully understand and interpret the environm ental impact of new kinds \\nof vehicles, gas emission standards, environmental regulation a nd ghg emissions im-\\npacts on the environment should be taken into consideration.\\n\\nAccording to literature [8, 18, 41], there are four major green house gasses that are \\nresponsible for the earth’s tempe rature.\\n\\nThese major GHGs are c arbon dioxide (CO 2), \\nmethane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and fluorinated gases; CO2’s enters the atmos-\\nphere basically as a product of fossil fuel (coal, natural gas,  burn process), Methane is \\nemitted during the production and transport of coal, natural ga s, and oil and Nitrous\", metadata={'page': 1, 'source': 'data/rag-agent-data\\\\connected_autonomous_vehicles.pdf'}),\n",
